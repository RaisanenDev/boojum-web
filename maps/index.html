<h1>Boojum Technical Reports Indexes</h1>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
</center>
<p>The technical reports donated by Boojum Research to Laurentian University have been indexed according to project name, geographic location, and company/organization name.  To use this website, click on the appropriate index, which will bring you to the index you have selected with a map.  From this point you can click directly on the map, or on one of the terms in index, and a window will open at the appropriate site on the map to provide details pertaining to that mine site.  Both the project name and the company name are linked directly to Laurentian University's catalogue.  By clicking on either of these items a search of Boojum Research's technical reports in Laurentian's catalogue will be performed automatically, and you will be directed to the results.
