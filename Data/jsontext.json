            "This report was the result of Ben Romanin's post-doctorate at Boojum Research funded by NRC Canada.",
            "The object of the dynamical model of biological polishing presented herein is to simulate the biogeochemical processes operating in the removal of heavy metals from mine drainage by means of periphytic algae. The model describes the growth of periphyton, and the interactions between periphyton, effluent, and fertilizer. Eventually it is hoped that it will serve as a management tool in that it will allow the user to determine the number of trees (or other substrate) and the amounts of nutrient to put into an effluent pool to maintain the metal concentrations below some legislatively set value year round. There are two markedly different approaches to modelling ecosystems in the scientific literature. In the \u201ctop down\u201d approach, models are constructed which call for a comprehensive and detailed description of ecosystem components. These models are typically empirical in nature, and based on on-site observations. The \u201ctop down\u201d approach is the methodology generally favoured by field biologists probably due to the the great complexity of natural systems they study. In contrast, the \u201cbottom up\u2019\u2019 approach relies on careful quantification of key inputs, outputs, and internal processes for simulation of system dynamics. This approach is generally favoured by physical scientists and engineers, largely because it has been successful in their respective disciplines for several centuries. The models constructed in this approach are typically mechanistic and mathematical. The model which I will construct is an attempt to bridge the two ways of doing things. I will adopt a mechanistic\r\ntheoretical perspective and identify the key biogeochemical processes operating in polishing ponds. However, I will use an empirical approach to quantify these complex processes first in the laboratory and then in the field on a site-specific basis. Finally, the mechanistic/empirical model constructed must be calibrated and verified in the field.",

Boojum Research was requested to\r\nprovide input with respect to Ecological Engineering measures which could be\r\nimplemented to assist in achieving the desired water quality.\r\nTo propose such measures, which are directed to assist ecosystem development in the\r\nClaude pit and sustain a healthy Claude Lake, it is necessary to determine if the pit\r\nwater, at decommissioning or in the long term, has the tendency toward a acid or\r\nneutral environment. This will determine the type of ecological measures which are\r\nrequired to assist ecosystem recovery.\r\nAfter a site visit, the complexity of the acid generation question was apparent. It was\r\ntherefore decided that the available background data on water quality and acid base\r\naccounting needed to be summarized and reviewed in order to gain an overview.\r\nBased on this review, the decommissioning approach was developed."

            "Bogs and coal acid mine drainage are closely linked at the\r\nVictoria Junction Coal processing plant of DEVCO in Sydney, Cape\r\nBreton, Nova Scotia. This geographical setting facilitates the\r\ninvestigation of these bogs with respect to the effects of AMD on\r\nthe ecosystem and determine their use in ameliorating the acidic\r\nconditions. The species assemblage is typical of that encountered\r\nin dwarf-shrub bogs of the Northeastern regions of the United\r\nStates and Canada. These bogs are dominated by Chamaedaphne\r\ncalyculata.\r\nThis report describes the status of the vegetation in both bogs\r\nwhich have received AMD for varying times. It summarizes both onsite\r\nand laboratory investigations. Through the use of\r\nmorphological-anatomical techniques, the death or growth of plant\r\nparts is determined.   The old bog, exhibits significant acid stress, although it had only\r\nreceived aerial deposition of coal and a diffuse flow of AMD. A\r\nsecond bog, the new bog, located immediately above the stressed bog\r\nwas healthy and unaffected by acid mine drainage until AMD seepage\r\nwas diverted into the bog at the end of summer 1988. In the new bog\r\nthe vegetation damage is much more severe than in the old bog and\r\nprognosis for continued survival is not good for many of the\r\nspecies that form the natural species assemblage of the bogs. The majority of shoot tips and lateral buds were found to be dead,\r\nsuggesting little hope for recovery of the plants in subsequent\r\nyears. Although damage was also observed in the same species of the\r\nold bog, the symptoms were not as severe as those seen in the new\r\nbog. Roots and rhizomes tended to show some damage but this was\r\nmuch reduced in comparison to that observed in the new bog. The most important species being able to survive is Typha\r\nlatifolia. Other grasses, sedges, and rushes may however compete\r\nin the colonizing of the dying bogs. Thus, a change in species\r\ncomposition of the bogs can be expected. To promote the growth of\r\ncattails in AMD conditions foliar fertilizers were tested.\r\nTreatment with noticeable beneficial effects was the application\r\nof 4-18-16 at a dilution of 1O:l.\r\nMorphological investigations of cattail roots indicated large\r\naccumulation of metals on the epidermis and the hypodermal layers.\r\nIn dead lateral roots, metal concentrations are highest and have\r\npenetrated the entire root cross section. Analysis of X-ray spectra\r\nof the metals by SEM of root cross sections, indicated that high\r\nconcentrations of Fe are associated with high levels of S and\r\ngreatly reduced concentrations of Ca. Crystal formation was noted\r\nin the iron-sulphate plaque accumulation in the roots. X-ray scans\r\nof cattail leaves growing in AMD conditions indicate the presence of glandular cell regions, called hyropoten with Fe levels three\r\ntimes that of the adjacent epidermal regions. These findings\r\nsuggest, that the cattail rhizosphere may be active in ameliorating\r\nAMD and that adaptations to high iron concentrations through\r\nactivation of particular cell regions of the leaves may occur."

            "Quantitative biogeochemical modelling is part of an overall effort to provide an integrated description of ecological systems within the framework of ecological engineering. It is a tool which can aid engineers and\r\nmanagers to simulate environmentalre mediation strategies, and which can provide an understanding of the dynamics of an ecosystem.\r\nThe Rabbit Lake drainage basin will change with time with respect to contaminant and nutrient loading. The reason for the changes are the depletion of nutrient supply from the waste rock piles and the addition\r\nsurface water flow from the decommissioned Rabbit Lake pit. These changes will affect the successional changes in the aquatic vegetation dominating the drainage basin. The aquatic vegetation control water quality in retaining both nutrients and contaminants within the drainage basin and through discharge.\r\nIn planning best decommissioning options for the drainage basin it is necessary to integrate, optimize and engineer the natural ecological processes which will take place. If the natural changes which will take place\r\nare not defined, control of contaminant discharge from the basin is not possible.  In order to understand these changes the main biogeochemical cycles in the Rabbit lake drainage basin are outlined based on the information the drainage basin gained during the study of the contaminant and nutrient cycling in Upper and Lower Link Lake.\r\nA biogeochemical model which is proposed to be developed aims to integrate all of the important biogeochemical cycles into a dynamic description capable of predicting concentrations of contaminants,\r\nother species, nutrients and algae."

Both elements are primarily complexed as organic particulates which are\r\nformed in association with the decomposition of added organic materials. In this form,\r\nthe As and Ni settle to the sediment where they are transformed into insoluble metal\r\nprecipitates as favourable Eh and pH conditions are encountered in the deeper portions\r\nof the sediment. Estimates of removal rates based on the experiments are 0.046 to 0.25 g.m-*.day-\u2019 for\r\nAs and 0.05 to 0.36 gm*.day\u201d for Ni.

            "Potential Alternate Treatment Systems.  Final Report: Se Removal from Coal Mine Valley\r\nFill Effluents: ARIES Subtask 2.2.3\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian Research Initiative for Environmental Science (ARIES), under the direction of the Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research at Virginia Tech was funded to coordinate a project to look into finding alternative treatment systems for selenium removal from coal mine valley fill ponds.  In 2012, Boojum Research was was engaged to carry out a pre-feasibility study to assess, if biological polishing, one of the ecological engineering processes, would lower selenium concentrations in coal mine valley fill ponds. The University of Kentucky and 4 coal mining companies participated in the study. The main objective was to determine if, and how much, selenium could be accumulated by the aquatic vegetation found in the valley fill ponds.\r\n\r\nPeriphytic or attached algae are known to be effective \u2018polishers\u2019 which adsorb and absorb contaminants from waste water. Selenium is one such waste water contaminant, although its structure is more complicated than most. Periphytic algae with associated ad/absorbed contaminants become buried in the sediment upon death. Phytoplankton (free-floating algae) generally leave the pond or sink to the sediment surface and decay, releasing selenium again to the water. Rooted vegetation can also sequester selenium, but mostly from the sediment and not from the water. The most effective algal group for biological polishing in alkaline water is the Characeae. This family of attached algae is one of the first invaders of freshly- dug ponds and ditches. These algae form dense perennial underwater meadows. These characteristics are especially suited for valley fill ponds, where mining companies have to remove the sediments periodically to maintain a certain water volume. Hence colonization by Characeae is likely.\r\n\r\nMany of the ponds visited and sampled had some Characeae growth.  Only one pond had an abundant underwater meadow. Some ponds were \u2018choked\u2019 with rooted emergent vegetation. In one pond with the extensive underwater meadow of Characeae selenium concentrations were lower by 7 \u00b5g L\u20101 when outflow concentrations were compared to inflow concentrations. Concentrations of in the biomass ranged from 2.2 to 8.0 mg.kg\u20101. \r\n\r\nIt was essential that part of the feasibility study determine whether selenium was enriched in the sediment in ponds colonized by the Characeae. This was assessed by collecting sediment cores and dividing them into vertical horizons. The surface sample (0\u20102 cm) contained 17 \u00b5g. g\u20101, decreasing to 7 \u00b5g.g\u20101 at a depth of 2\u20104 cm and further to 1.37 \u00b5g.g\u20101. The deeper portions and those below in 6 cm, concentrations of around 0.6 \u00b5g. g\u20101 were reported.  These selenium concentration decreases with depth are a strong indication that the use of characean algae should be further studied. The challenge will be to determine the conditions needed to support the growth of an underwater meadow of the algae. Seeding the ponds after dredging with biomass or oospores (a type of seed) would likely be enough to ensure a healthy population. Using this relatively cost-effective approach would likely lead to reductions in the selenium concentration of the effluents leaving valley fill ponds."

            "Ecological effluent treatment consists of promoting and supporting growth of indigenous\r\nbiota which bio-mineralize contaminants, leading to containment and stabilization of\r\ncontaminants within the waste management area. With two field investigations (2006\r\nand 2007) of the Zinifex Mine site, indigenous microbial/algal material was found to\r\ncontain an average of 11.6% Ca, 12.0% S and 2.5% Mg, the main salts of the effluents.\r\nUtilizing literature growth rates, it is estimated, that about 900 g of dry weight biomass\r\ngrows per square meter per dry season. The growth rates translate into an extraction of\r\nabout 1.0 t of Ca, 1.1 t of S and 0.22 t of Mg per ha surface area from the effluent.\r\nSelection of suitable growth substrates along with growth rates specific to the site are\r\nneeded to define design parameters for the pilot scale tests, both in Dam # 3 and in\r\nEvaporation Pond.\r\nThe bio-mineralization capacity of the biota is lower in Evaporation Pond than in Dam\r\n#3. In Evaporation pond the accumulation of Ca is 0.51 t per ha per dry season and\r\nlower for S (0.14 t) and Mg (0.046 t). Improvement of growth and uptake of elements\r\ncan be expected when growth limitations of the biota are known and ameliorated.\r\nNutrient ratios of healthy algae biomass are well documented and are used to indicate\r\ngrowth limitations. For the algal mats in Evaporation Pond the ratio of carbon to\r\nnitrogen suggest that nitrogen is more limiting than carbon. On the other hand, nitrogen\r\nand phosphorus ratios for the mats and the sediment, suggest that nitrogen is not as\r\nlimiting as phosphorus.\r\nGrowth promotion trough the addition of phosphorus will increase growth. Geochemical modeling indicates that precipitation of calcium phosphate is likely to take place. This\r\ncould delay a rapid growth response, as the precipitate is relegated to the sediment where\r\nit will be converted back to the water by microbes. Measurements of pH, Eh, electrical\r\nconductivity, oxygen at different depths were obtained in Evaporation Pond, which\r\nsuggest the development of a chemical stratification, supported by reductions in sulphate\r\nconcentrations in the water at 6 m depth. The extent, origin and effect of the chemical\r\nstratification need to be verified through an extensive sampling campaign. Test with\r\nphosphate additions in limno-corrals are suggested.\r\nThe monitoring data base (2004 -2006 V-notch and 2000 to 2006 Evaporation Pond) of\r\nthe chemical composition of effluents associated with the mine waste management area\r\nwas used to derive a framework for annual contaminant load to be treated. Material\r\nbalances and water usage were estimated per annum. Several questions remain open and\r\nrequire resolution. Preliminary assessments of the seasonal contaminant loads suggest\r\nthat promotion of the existing bio-mineralization process will facilitate salt management\r\npre- and post closure, implemented through a series of well defined milestones."

            "In the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, mining has, for a long time, been\r\na major industry. The resource industry continues to be a significant economic\r\nfactor in the Canadian North, and due to increasing environmental awareness,\r\nthe regulation of mining activities for the protection of the environment is an\r\nimportant issue of debate. In both territories, environmental concerns have been expressed at several lev-\r\nels about inactive or abandoned hard rock mining operations, some of which\r\nstarted operations as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, and in\r\nthe 1930's to 1950's.\r\nMining is associated with the production of waste materials \r\n(tailings and waste rock), which could affect, if they are not managed\r\nappropriately, the environmental quality in the vicinity of the mine site. It is \r\npossible that abandoned mine sites generate environmentally unacceptable conditions.\r\nEnvironmental degradation from past hard rock mining operations can\r\nbe expected, but this is likely less significant than the environmental problems\r\nwhich may be caused by mine abandonment of both present and future operations,\r\ngiven the difference in scale between past and present activities. It is\r\ngenerally accepted that environmentally sound solutions have to be found for the management of wastes after cessation of the mining activities. Such solutions however, are particularly difficult to perceive in the absence of a technical evaluation of the long term environmental effects of mining wastes. The objective of this work was to obtain a perspective on the magnitude of potential environmental implications inherited from past hard rock (lode) operations. Geographical, historical and environmental data on 21 inactive mine\r\nsites in the Northwest Territories and 10 sites in the Yukon have been summarized and evaluated with respect to water quality objectives and metal concentrations reported for background ( 11 non mining environment 11 ) values for sediments and soils. Sites were selected for inclusion in the evaluation based on two criteria. One\r\nwas that the site had been abandoned before 1983 and the other that the mine site\r\nwas associated with a mill, i.e. producing tailings. However, inclusion of a site\r\nin this report carries no legal implications with respect to decommissioning of\r\nthe property. Historical and geographical data about each site were assembled\r\nfrom open literature as well as other sources. Environmental data, consisting\r\npredominantly of elemental concentrations in water and sediments associated\r\nwith the mine site and those in tailings, originated mainly from monitoring government and mining company files. In Volumes 11 and 111, historical and geographical information is presented for\r\neach mine site for the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, respectively. For\r\neach site, topographical maps, aerial and site photographs are associated with a\r\nfact sheet, which contains information about the history, geology, milling and\r\ntailings. Potential environmental concerns, based on this information, are identified. In Volume I, monitoring data from each site are organized into tables (hard copy and floppies Appendix to Vol. I) from which minimum and maximum concentrations of elements for each site were extracted. These values formed\r\nthe basis on which the elements As, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Ni, Se, Ag , Zn and Hg\r\nwere evaluated, comparing the concentrations to natural ranges reported for\r\nsediments and soils or water quality objectives set for the protection of aquatic\r\nlife. Other elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cl, Co, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Na, S, Si, Th,\r\nVa, U) and physical parameters, (for example pH and electrical conductivity),\r\nwere recorded and used as descriptive and comparative characteristics of the\r\nthree environmental components (water, sediment and tailings) evaluated. Milling processes used and the environmental fate of milling reagents- is discussed in relation to long term environmental implications. In one mining operation (Discovery - NWT-5), mercury used in amalgamation is the only process reagent which might have contributed to some environmental degradation. Lead, arser)ic, mercury and cyanide, frequently evoke concerns in relation tomining wastes. These elements are discussed, with a focus on their environmental fate in the long term. The ranges of arsenic and lead concentrations found in the tailings, compared to those in soil, revealed that for both elements, the values generally reflect those of local mineralogy, since the elemental\r\ncomposition of the tailings differs only marginally from that of the host rock.\r\nBoth arsenic and lead are natural constituents of the mine site environs. Mercury, on the other hand, when concentrations in the tailings are found to be elevated, may be present as a result of past milling practices. Cyanide used in the extraction of gold would be present in the environment of the inactive mine sites in the form of cyano-metal complexes, since these are persistent substances. Given its biological and photochemical degradation, cyanide can be considered an environmental concern strictly related to ongoing operations. For\r\nabandoned mine sites, therefore, it is a concern of the past. It was concluded\r\nthat when local mineralogy and milling processes of the past are thoroughly\r\nconsidered, environmental concerns could not be substantiated by an exhaustive\r\nevaluation of available monitory data. \r\nSeveral characteristics, for example, acid generation, which are essential in determining potential environmental concerns relating to abandoned or to be abandoned mining wastes, were identified. The abandoned sites evaluated for both territories were categorized with respect to missing essential environmental\r\ninformation, i.e. where concerns could not be substantiated or refuted based\r\nsolely on the available data. Conclusions and recommendations were formulated in conjunction with an evaluation of health concerns and safety considerations directly related to human\r\nhealth, such as site location with respect to public access, proximity to potable\r\nwater supplies, as well as the absence or presence of essential environmental\r\ninformation. In summary, it was concluded, that severe environmental degradation could not\r\nbe identified at any of the 31 sites in both territories where wastes have\r\nremained unattended over at least the past decade. For 5 sites, potential environmental concerns with respect to degradation of land/and or water quality appear warranted, and a focused investigation is recommended for Discovery, Ptarmigan and Thompson-Lundmark in the Northwest Territories, and for Mount\r\nNansen and Venus in the Yukon. The essential components for such an investigation are outlined, with specific reference to that information necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the potential long term environmental concerns.\r\nSuch information was often missing from the data available for this present\r\nstudy. The data base for inactive hard rock mining operations assembled here,\r\nwas found to provide a technical basis on which criteria relevant to the development of suitable abandonment procedures for future hard rock mining operations in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon could be formulated. Surely an understanding of the environmental implications of past operations may provide the means for ensuring the future protection of the environment."

            "The B-Zone pit was intentionally flooded with water from the adjacent Collins Bay in the\r\nwinter of 1991/1992. Evidence that contaminants are not being released from the pit walls\r\nto the water column and the processes responsible for improvements observed in pit water\r\nquality are described. Limnological data gathered for a decade support this finding.\r\nSince 1991, the water quality in the pit lake has been rigorously and regularly monitored\r\nwith close attention paid to the primary productivity (phytoplankton quantification) of the\r\nflooded pit. An elemental mass balance has been calculated, based upon materials\r\nacquired by suspending sedimentation traps at various depths, and bottom sediment\r\nsampling. By 1997, this was indicating that natural cleansing processes were effectively\r\nreducing both Ni and As, the contaminants of concern, in the water.\r\nThe striking singularity in the data showed that concentrations of Ni increased every spring\r\nafter ice break-up. It was initially believed that Ni was being released by the decomposition\r\nof suspended organic matter and recycling. However, by 1998 the dynamics of the lake\r\nwere well understood and it seemed apparent that the only explanation could be an\r\nexternal source of Ni. That source, a mineralized perimeter road, was identified and in 2001\r\nwas eliminated. Since then, the concentrations of Ni in the water column have no longer\r\nincreased seasonally. The steady state of contaminants in the lake water, and its\r\nsediments, provides assurance that no new contaminants are entering the pit.  Active contaminant removal by pumping of water from the pit lake to maintain water level\r\nwas also evaluated. This provided evidence against one of the last arguments that dilution\r\nfrom clean water entering the pit lake was leading to the reductions in As and Ni\r\nconcentrations and not the natural water cleansing processes. If necessary, these\r\nprocesses could be enhanced further by fertilization. A final decommissioning strategy for\r\nthe B-Zone Pit has not yet been determined."

It\r\nincorporates data compiled from 20 years of monitoring water quality in the basin.\r\nThe natural processes documented in this report effectively remove uranium, 226Ra and\r\nother contaminants from the water column, and sequester them in the lake sediments;\r\nwith time, the sediments will be further isolated by the gradual terrestrialization of the\r\nlakes brought about by semiaquatic and submerged vegetation including the\r\nCharaceae that are naturally present in the lakes and enhanced in Upper Link Lake.\r\nThe ecological characteristics (semi-aquatic and aquatic vegetation identification,\r\nlimnological and topographical features) of the drainage basin are analogous to those\r\ndocumented in geological studies on the genesis of fluviatile surficial uranium deposits.\r\nThe existence of these mineral forming (minerotrophic) conditions in the Rabbit Lake\r\ndrainage basin guarantees the effectiveness of the natural uranium removal process there.\r\nKnowledge gained from this study could provide the basis for an ecologically based\r\ndecommissioning strategy integrated into institutional control. The natural processes\r\nidentified in this report, could be further enhanced to increase the natural retention of\r\ncontaminants and reduce the release of 226Ra. The promotion of terrestrialization and the\r\ncreation of new Characeaen habitat could be implemented gradually during the life of the\r\nRabbit Lake Operation. Such modifications would not only complete the restoration of an\r\necologically disturbed drainage basin, but transform it into a dynamic component of an\r\nenvironmentally sound, economical decommissioning strategy."

        "description": [
            "The ecological treatment system consists of three (3) components which constitute the treatment train. The first component removes iron by facilitating oxidation and nucleation of small iron particles. This occurs in two or more open ponds depending on the flow volume to be treated. The chemical characteristics of the AMD determine if aeration is needed. This can be achieved by passing the AMD flow over a cascade. In the first open\r\npond the precipitates accumulate. Depending on the precipitate formation rate, the nucleation sites can be provided by installing sediment curtains into the pool. The relatively clear colorless acidic AMD is collected in the second open pond. This first step is the most important step, as effective removal of precipitated iron is needed to minimize coating of organic matter in the following component the ARUM (Acid Reduction Using\r\nMicrobiology) ponds.\r\nThe second component is the construction of the ARUM ponds. For these ponds to function a microbial active sediment needs to be constructed and a living floating\r\nvegetation cover is placed over the surface of the pond. The sediment construction\r\nrequires two types of organic matter easily degradable organic matter and highly\r\nrecalcitrant material (slow or non degradable). The easily degradable organics will serve\r\nas food sources to the microbes and the recalcitrant material will provide the structure for\r\nthe biofilms to housing the microbes. In these ponds low oxygen conditions prevail. The\r\nroot mass suspended over the sediment of the living floating islands, provides organic\r\nacids or the easily degradable organic matter, to the sediment.\r\nThe detailed microbial activity of ARUM has only be assessed pragmatically, based on the scientific and microbiological knowledge, but not quantified. Geochemical\r\nsimulations using PHREEQC\r\n(http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc) of the pore water which evolved in constructed sediments indicated that conditions for bio-mineralization are\r\nindeed given. The saturation indexes suggesting that relatively stable metals are formed\r\nin these constructed sediments. Furthermore in multiple empirical field and laboratory\r\ntests reliably increases in pH and decreases in Eh have been documented. Thus these\r\nponds achieve significant reduction of metals in the AMD or ARD.\r\nA third component of the treatment train might be a biological polishing pond. However\r\nthis is not always needed and depends on the location of the discharge of the system and\r\nthe location where compliance with the discharge regulations is expected. A biological\r\npolishing pond is an open pond in which through adsorption to algal cell walls elements\r\nare removed from the water. These would be elements, which would need to be oxidized\r\nin order to be adsorbed and which were not removed in the precipitation pond, were\r\nmany metals are removed together with the precipitating iron. In most system constructed to date, such a pond was not needed. Depending on the geochemical characteristics of the\r\nAMD, all three components of the treatment train can be added in sequence. The\r\ndetermination of the sequence of the components, the sizing of the ponds is the main\r\nobjective of the feasibility study, as this aspect is always site specific. Unfortunately for\r\nthis project the elemental composition of the AMD and the two treatment components,\r\niron oxidation / precipitation and ARUM, could not yet be determined, as the analytical\r\ninstrumentation was out of order. It is recommended that this aspect will be addressed,\r\nonce the pilot system is constructed and taken into operation. From this data\r\nadjustments and alterations may well be needed.\r\nThe Dapo site was selected based on economic and topographic criteria detailed in the\r\nsite selection report (attached as Appendix 1). The pilot system is constructed based on\r\nthe data obtained during the feasibility study. These data are key to designing effective\r\nfunctioning of the treatment. The oxidation rate of the AMD determines if an oxidation\r\ncascade is needed or not and it determines the size of the ponds for the iron precipitates to\r\nsettle. In addition, tests have to be carried out to determine the suitability of the locally available organic matter to construct the ARUM sediments.\r\nFinally with the running of the treatment system through two seasons (two dry and two\r\nrainy seasons) the design criteria are developed for the full treatment system of the site.\r\nWith these data the scale up of the system is facilitated to achieve complete treatment of\r\nthe effluents from the adit. It is important to recognize, that pilot system\r\nimplementation is a stepwise procedure, which, when carried out systematically, will\r\nprovide the groundwork for other treatment system with similar AMD characteristics."

            "The occurrence of metal-contaminated acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the most problematic situations facing the mining industry today (Hutchinson and Ellison 1992; Ledin and Pedersen 1996). Sources of AMD include the walls of underground and open pit mining sites, waste rock and ore stock piles, tailings waste, and spent heap leach piles from leaching operations. If left uncontrolled and untreated, AMD has the potential to contaminate surface and groundwater broadly enough to adversely affect regional water quality, as well as indigenous fish and wildlife populations (Hutchinson and Ellison 1992; Orabkowski 1993). The chemical composition of AMD is determined principally by mine waste mineralogy, and the amount of water (meteoric and/or groundwater) infiltrating and percolating through the waste (Filion and Ferguson 1990). Iron sulfide minerals, such as pyrite, begin to undergo chemical oxidation almost immediately upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen and water (Evangelou and Zhang 1995). In the absence of neutralizing agents (e.g., carbonates or clays), these chemical reactions produce acid and liberate various metals whose concentrations will vary as a function of the composition of the ore and waste rock (Blowes and Ptacek 1994). As pH decreases, bacteria and ferric iron catalyze the overall process to a rate 10 to 20 times the abiotic chemical rate (Stumm and Morgan 1996; Okereke and Stevens 1991). Rainfall, snow melt, and other hydrological processes then leach the acid solutions from the waste sites into downstream and groundwater environments. Typically, AMD exhibits pH values well below 5.6 (the pH of meteoric water in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide) that are accompanied by high concentrations of dissolved sulfate, ferrous iron, and metals such as Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Au, and Pb (Hutchinson and Ellison 1992; Orabkowski 1993). \r\nThe primary goal of AMD treatment is to prevent acid generation at new sites, and to abate acid drainage where it occurs at existing facilities. Two basic approaches are used. These are (I) control of acid generation and leachate migration, and (ii) collection and treatment of AMO (Ledin and Pedersen 1996). Technologies currently employed to control acid generation and leachate migration include liming or carbonate treatment, application of bactericides, inundation (i.e., flooding) with water to maintain anaerobic conditions that prohibit sulfide mineral oxidation, and installation of dry covers to prevent water infiltration. Collection and treatment of AMO contamination in surface waters is accomplished using alkaline recharge trenches or wetland systems (natural or engineered, for example, the Boojum ARUM [acid reduction using microbiology] treatment). Treatment protocols for in situ Bioremediation of Mine Area Groundwater Inorganic Contamination (BioMAGIC) are not presently available, but are urgently required as field studies have demonstrated that infiltration of AMD into groundwater is common at mine sites (Ledin and Pedersen 1996). This study is focused on assessing the feasibility of an in situ BioMAGIC treatment process to mitigate the\udbc0\udc03 potential adverse impact of AMD contamination along groundwater flow paths. The concept is based on using urea-degrading bacteria to increase the pH and alkalinity of acidic groundwater containing high concentrations of dissolved metals. Specifically, the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea by bacteria is apt to be of considerable benefit as the reaction consumes protons and promotes the development of alkaline conditions according to the following reactions:  CO(NH2)2 + 2H20 = 2NH/ + C03- (1)  \r\nH + C03- = HC03- (2)    \r\nThe intention is not only to reduce the extent of acidification that normally accompanies the hydrolysis of dissolved metals in mine drainage, particularly ferric iron, but also to initiate the removal of dissolved metals through mineral precipitation and sorption reactions (Stumm and Morgan 1996; Chapman et al. 1983; Herbert 1994; Herbert 1996). Anticipated benefits include restoration of normal pH values and substantially reduced metal-loading in water that is apt to move off mine-site property. Moreover, urea is produced as a bulk commodity agricultural fertilizer that is readily available (Tisdale et al. 1985). \r\nThe target site for this investigation is the South Bay mine site in northwestern Ontario. Boojum Research has identified a plume of AMD contaminated groundwater that ultimately discharges into a small lake located approximately 800 m from the n\udbc0\udc01arest surface source of AMD. A detailed site description is found in Appendix A. The basic premise for BioMAGIC at South Bay is that urea would be introduced into the contaminated groundwater system (most likely through installation of infiltration galleries across the groundwater flow path) to stimulate the activity of indigenous urea-degrading bacteria to a point where a significant increase in groundwater pH can be recognized. The approach used to evaluate the potential use of urea-degrading bacteria for BIOMAGIC involved both geochemical modeling and microbiological investigations. Flow-through column work has also been undertaken to learn about the potential impact of bacteria on groundwater flow in porous geological media. Construction of the geochemical model using the MINEQL + program was based on South Bay groundwater chemistry provided exclusively by Boojum Research. The objective of the modeling exercise was to determine (i) the extent to which groundwater pH would change in response to urea degradation, (ii) the minimum amount of urea that must be degraded to restore near-neutral pH, and (iii) the impact of anticipated pH changes on the aqueous chemistry and solubility of dissolved metals. Microbiological studies encompassed a survey of South Bay groundwaters to determine whether any urea-degrading bacteria existed in the contaminated aquifer, and to identify specific locations with conditions favorable to their growth. Subsequent work involved single colony isolation of South Bay urea-degrading bacteria to compare their activity with that of a reference bacterial culture (Bacillus pasturil) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). This microbiological information is needed to identify areas where BioMAGIC, is most likely to be implemented successfully, and whether natural populations of bacteria might be used or, alternatively, whether a need exists to add urea\u00addegrading bacteria to the groundwater system."

            "The former gold mine at South Bay, Ontario adjacent to Confederation Lake north of\r\nEar Falls, Ontario has been shut down for over 10 years. Presently the mine site is\r\nundergoing closeout using ecological engineering and bioremediation technology.\r\nAn extensive monitoring program has been in effect at the South Bay mine site for the\r\npast several years. The results of this monitoring program have been used to provide\r\ndirection for several remedial actions on the site. In addition, it has been used to\r\nmonitor the effectiveness of these actions and focus future remedial work. As part of\r\nthe investigations on the site, predictive modelling was used in 1988 to attempt to\r\npredict the movement of contaminants in the groundwater, using the hydrogeological\r\nmodel developed for the site at that time and the CHINTEX model. During the ensuing\r\nyears, it was discovered that the main seepage pathway from the tailings was not into\r\nConfederation Lake but rather into Mud Lake through a large deposit of gravel which\r\nwas named the \u201cKalin canyon\u201d.\r\nIn light of the increased data base collected during the past ten years and the\r\nreinterpretation of the site hydrogeology, it was decided appropriate at this time to construct a numerical model that can be used to simulate the existing groundwater flow\r\npatterns and be used to predict contaminant movement. The model, once calibrated\r\ncan be used to assess the effectiveness of the various remedial alternatives and to\r\nassess the impact of changing properties such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity\r\nas a result of some of the biological processes used in the remediation.\r\nThe three basic objectives of the Phase one modelling described in this report were the\r\nfollowing: Develop a global site-wide model encompassing all of the significant water\r\nsheds in the vicinity of the site in order to determine the effective dilution via\r\ngroundwater of contaminated water with water from uncontaminated areas. This\r\ncan then be used together with measured surface water flows to determine\r\nexpected contaminant concentrations in various water bodies.\r\nUse the results of the global site-wide model to construct a more detailed tailings\r\narea model and calibrate this model to simulate the measured existing flow\r\npatterns.\r\nUse the detailed tailings area model to simulate the release and transport of\r\ncontaminants from the tailings area into the various receiving water bodies As stated above, two models were developed for this study, a global site-wide model\r\nand a more detailed tailings area model.\r\nThe major input parameters required by both of the models are summarized in Chapter\r\n2 and the development and results of the global site-wide model are described in\r\nChapter 3. The development and results of the failings area model are given in\r\nChapter 4. Conclusions and recommendations for further work are given in Chapter 5."

            "In 1994, the decommissioning activities for the South Bay mine site focused on two main\r\nareas. For the overall site the measures taken in 1993 were evaluated (trial phosphate rock\r\napplication to tailings and Boomerang Lake sediment and ARUM beach installation on Decant\r\nPond). The biological polishing process used in Boomerang Lake was summarized, focussing\r\non contaminant fate.The mine/mill site was surveyed using EM to determine changes brought\r\nabout by the diversion of the seepage from the Back fill Raise area to Boomerang Lake. A report\r\nwas issued in December1994 which concluded that the measures for Decant Pond had been\r\nsuccessfully curtailing the deterioration of the water quality. The seepage from the mine/mill\r\nsite have been diverted away from Confederation Lake. However, the contaminant load to\r\nBoomerang lake has increased. It was recommended that application of phosphate rock to the\r\nlake sediments is required to curtail acidification due to iron oxidation. Due to logistics problems encountered in 1993, the phosphate rock application to Boomerang lake was carried\r\nout in 1994. Eighty tonnes of phosphate rock were made into a slurry and applied via barge\r\nto the lake sediment in 1994. The tailings have given rise to a deterioration of the water quality in Mud Lake, which was predicted based on the reevaluation of the hydrological conditions in the tailings basin in\r\n1993. Insufficient quantities of water were reporting to the ground water diversion ditch at the\r\nsouthern end of the tailings deposits. In early 1994, the deterioration of Mud lake was\r\ndocumented. Subsequently, activities in 1995 centred around the hydrology of the tailings\r\nand drainage basin. The hydrology of the tailings basin was originally defined in 1987, excluding the area around Mud Lake. During 1994, the sampling efforts in and around Mud Lake were intensive in order\r\nto define the origin and the pathways of the contaminants moving towards Mud Lake. A report\r\nwas issued summarizing the historic and current status of the area. Based on a preliminary\r\nhydrological investigation focusing on the area between the tailings and Mud Lake, a deep\r\nbedrock valley was described, which appeared to define the seepage path underneath Mud Lake, leading to the discharge of the seepage at the north end of Mud Lake. Many hydrological\r\nquestions were raised by the investigations of 1994, the first year when Mud Lake was\r\ncontaminated. Thus, to answer key questions, extensive EM surveys were carried out in 1995\r\nto define the contaminant pathway and bedrock conditions. This information wasconsidered essential to any remedial action plan. After completion of the 1994 investigation, it was possible to estimate, utilizing elemental concentrations of surface water in the drainage basin along with flows and precipitation data, a contaminated ground water discharge volume of 0.6 to 1.0 L/s. This volume of contaminated seepage was\r\nconsidered significant, leading to potential contamination of lakes further north. The 1995\r\nwork therefore concentrated on defining possible pathways of contaminants to lakes further\r\nnorth of MudLake. The hydrological balance (precipitation/ infiltration/ evaporation) produced\r\nan expected surface waterflow volume for the drainage basin containing the tailings and Mud\r\nlake. These estimates agreed very well with the measured flow volumes leaving Mud Lake,\r\nthe ground waterseepage discharge and flows leaving Decant Pond. These results suggested\r\nthat it might be possible to contain the contaminants in Mud Lake, if the drainage basin\r\nprovides a solid containment structure. Extensive coverage of the site by EM measurements in the areas surrounding Mud Lake was implemented in early 1995, followed by a hydrogeological investigation where piezometers were installed to define the seepage characteristics. The bedrock topography of the tailings\r\nneeded to be refined, as containment of the contaminants within the drainage basin could also\r\nbe assisted through identification of the location where the ground water seepage was leaving\r\nthe tailings deposit. If such a location could be defined, many alternatives would arise in\r\nselecting options to contain contaminants. Therefore, the activities in 1995 focused heavily on collecting hydrological information addressing the spatial distribution of the seepage path and locating the origin of the seepage from within the tailings basin. A summary of the key findings of the hydrology and bedrock definitions is given in Section 2.  Although water balance calculations for the Mud Lake/tailings drainage basin agreed with the relatively sporadic flow measurements and the mass balance using conservative elements of\r\nin the surface water, the aerial extent of a plume which would be moving below ground out\r\nof the drainage basin was not known. In Section 3, electromagnetic survey data are presented\r\nwhich are used to define the extent of the plume in the Mud Lake drainage basin. The EM\r\nsurvey can also be used as a monitoring tool to determine movement of the plume through\r\nrepeat surveys in subsequent years. From the hydrological understanding, based on the data collected in 1987, it was expected that surface and ground water would leave the tailings basin via Decant Pond outflow and\r\npassing through the muskeg between the tailings and Mud Lake. Zinc removal was effective\r\nto date with extensive algal growth. Surface water leaving Decant Pond could only improve\r\nfurther upon passage through the muskeg. Contaminants leaving the tailings basin via the\r\nground water was evaluated in 1987 and 1988. Piezometer water quality was used, together\r\nwith modelling of natural contaminant attenuation, to determine potential problem areas of\r\nConfederation lake. The assessment indicated that sufficient attenuation will take place and\r\ncontaminants would not reach Confederation Lake. At the time this assessment of a reasonable\r\nevaluation had to be reconsidered, given the findings in 1994. The 1994 hydrological investigation found the depth of the seepage path at16 m, discharging directly into the north end of Mud Lake with a water quality which suggested no natural attenuation of contaminants. A reassessment of the status of the ground water chemistry,\r\ncollected sporadically since 1987, was carried out along with an evaluation of seasonal\r\nchanges in the surface waters, monitored on a more regular basis. The objective of these\r\nevaluations, presented in Section 4, was to determine if the ground waterand surface water\r\nconditions of the entire drainage basin had undergone significant changes which warranted\r\nattention."

            "In many areas of Canada, uranium mill tailings are produced or have been produced in the past. Abandoned areas which received the tailings material contain hazardous materials such as heavy metals, radioactive isotopes and sometimes acid-generating materials. The long term fate of theses materials is largely unknown. Sites are open to the natural processes of invasion by biota and exposed to weathering and leaching processes.  It was the aim of the Experience '79 project to identify and delineate invading biota by studying abandoned uranium mill tailings sites in the Bancroft area, with the ultimate aim of compiling information on the potential hazards associated with these sites."

            "It is known that once exposed to an oxidizing environment (water or oxygen) as series of reactions occur at the surface of sulfide minerals, as pyrite, and lead to acid drainage generation.The major steps of pyrite oxidation are:\r\n(1)\r\nOxidation of sulfur in presence of atmospheric oxygen [1]\r\nFeS2 + 7/2O2 + H2O \udbc0\udcd9 Fe2+ + 2SO42\u2010 + 2H+\r\n(2)\r\nOxidation of ferrous iron Fe(II) (production of ferric iron Fe(III)). At low pH Fe the reaction rates strongly increased by microbial activity (e.g.,Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans). Bacteria use the reaction as an energy\u2010generating process, acting as a catalyze Fe2+ oxidation to Fe3+, with rates 5 or 6 times higher than in sterile conditions, increasing acid generation. The soluble Fe3+ formed under these conditions, can effectively scavenge electrons from S(\u20101) in pyrite, generating more Fe2+ once again, and this process is recycled. [1,2]\r\nFe2+ + 1/4O2 + H+ \udbc0\udcd9 Fe3+ + 1/2H2O\r\nFeS2 + 14 Fe3+ + 8H2O \udbc0\udcd9 15 Fe2+ + 2SO42\u2010+ 16H+\r\n(3)\r\nHydrolysis and precipitation of ferric complexes and minerals (ferryhidrite, schwertmannite, goethite or jarosite) when the acid mine water, rich in ferric iron , reaches the surface. Most of the acid is produced at this stage [1].\r\nFe3++ 3 H2O \udbc0\udcd9 Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+\r\nThe development of a feasible, low cost and long\u2010term inhibition of Fe2+ oxidation process at sulfide surface in solid waste accumulations could drive the mining industry towards a more sustainable future. Such technology should be focused on the understanding of the chemical and biological processes occurring on the surface of the sulphide minerals, as pyrite and pyrrhotite.\r\nDifferent strategies to this problem have been proposed in the literature in the last years. Among them, the technologies designed to generate a physical barrier between pyrite surface and the oxidants agents seem to be the most promising techniques. Iron\u2010phosphate or silicate coatings [3,4,5], complexation of ferric iron [6,7] and, more recently, the effect of lipids with two hydropobic tails on pyrite surface [8,9] prove to be effective in laboratory studies. All the techniques require the addition of specific chemical solutions to the waste rock as, phosphate or silicate rich solutions, H2O2, chemical complexing agent, lipids and organic solvents. However, none of these methodologies has been validated on field conditions mainly because of scale factor, which makes difficult to estimate the cost and environmental impact that these solutions may have.\r\nBoojum Research LTD has been actively trying to address this problem since 1992, developing simultaneously laboratory (waste rock drums) and field tests (Inco, Buchans, Stanrock, etc) where natural phosphate rock (NPR), alone or combined with other\r\ncomponents (horse manure, straw, etc) was added to waste rock and tailings, respectively. This technology is proposed by this company has being suitable to groundwater and seepage treatment but, most of all, as a long\u2010term AMD passivation technique.\r\nSome parameters of this technology are not fully optimized but, field and lab demonstration tests have shown that a long\u2010term inhibition technique may be possible due to the chemical properties of NPR plus the initiation of a biofilm coating on pyritic surfaces. However, the passivation mechanisms still need to be clarified in order to develop a final commercial product.\r\nIn this report we evaluate, for the first time, the surface of a complete set of rocks use by Boojum in two exposure periods of the Waste Rock Experiment (WRD) in order to gather more basic information for the passivation concept comprehension."

            "Inactive uranium mill tailings were surveyed in the Province of Ontario to describe their surface characteristics, identify naturally invading biota, and determine essential chemical and physical parameters associated with the tailings. \r\nInactive tailings sites can have wet areas, tailings completely covered with water, and dry areas. In the wet areas of most sites, wetland vegetation stands were found which were dominated by species of cattails (Typhaceae), along with some species of rushes (Juncaceae) and sedges ( Cyperceae). Dry areas of the tailings exhibited a variety of surface features which are often a reflection of different amelioration efforts. Most of the indigenous species of vascular plants identified on dry areas of the tailings occurred only sporadically. Invading plants found on most sites were the tree species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera).   Elemental concentration and some physical characteristics of the tailings collected from a depth of 0-20 cm were determined. The concentrations of calcium and uranium were found to have extremely large variations and cannot be considered typical for the tailings material of a site or an area (Bancroft and/or Elliot Lake). Concentrations of aluminum, copper, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and nickel in the tailings were less varied. In all tailings materials from the Bancroft area, concentration ranges of the above elements were similar to those of soils collected from both areas and to the values quoted in literature. The elements sodium and lead are possibly enriched in the tailings of the Bancroft area compared to mineral soils from the same area, and to soils in general. For the tailings in the Elliot Lake area, aluminum, chlorine, magnesium and nickel were determined in concentration ranges typical of soils, but manganese and sodium were depleted in the surface of those tailings. Lead concentrations in the tailings were elevated in this area. Thus, considering concentrations of selected elements in tailings, differences between the mining areas are evident. A comparison of pH, electrical conductivity, loss-on-ignition and moisture loss of tailings with that of soils, suggests that tailings differ drastically in these characteristics. These results are important with respect to natural rehabilitation of inactive or abandoned uranium mill tailings.  Uptake of heavy metals and radionuclides was evaluated in trees found in the dry areas and in cattails (Typha latifolia) in the wetland areas. In trees, the metals and radionuclides were distributed throughout all organs whereas in the cattails, a large fraction was retained in the roots. Concentration factors (plant/tailings concentrations) were found to be generally below unity, with some exceptions for radium-226 in the cattails. \r\nWater bodies on tailings and surface water leaving the tailings, before and after treatment, were characterized in this survey. The surface waters on the tailings and seepages were usually acidic; however, the pH was not lower than that of most waters leaving natural acidic environments (bogs or muskegs). The treatment of the effluent water was found to reduce production of biomass as estimated by determination of chlorophyll a. Radionuclide and metal concentrations in waters associated with tailings were found to have extremely large variations. Detailed work is required to determine the factors controlling the physical and chemical characteristics of surface waters on tailings.  Aquatic_ bryophytes have invaded some water bodies on the tailings, and acid tolerant algae were evident in most of the water associated with the tailings. The promotion of growth of these biota together with the wetland communities on the tailings beaches may provide some means of natural amelioration for the wet areas of the inactive tailings sites in the long-term. Some inactive tailings sites, described in this survey, were completely covered with water and wetland vegetation. The interactions of these biota with the tailings could be investigated on these sites. \r\nEcological processes occurring on inactive uranium mill tailings which were identified in this survey are essential in evaluating the long-term fate of these waste sites."

Concentrations of radionuclides and heavy metals in uranium tailings, nontailings mineral areas, vegetation, and surface waters have been measured.  The differences between wetlands and terrestrial areas of the uranium tailings are described.  Concentrations of radionuclides and heavy metals in vegetation and surface waters from uranium mill tailings were generally lower.  Uptake of radium-226 and lead-210 in cattail populations and trees (white birch and trembling aspen) appeared to be species-specific. Aerial deposition of tailings on the above-ground leafy matter of trees did not seem to affect their radionuclide concentration.  In the wetlands on uranium tailings, radionuclide and heavy metal concentrations in cattail litter suggest that the litter acts as a sink for theses elements.  The concentrations of the contaminants in surface waters on uranium tailings are not much different from those in waters on control nontailing areas."

            "Environmental pathways of long-lived radionuclides from uranium mill tailings to the environment should be evaluated in communities which as closely as possible reflect those of the future.  Typical early colonizer species have established on uranium mill tailings two decades after abandonment. The growth characteristics of these early colonizers have been evaluated as well as the radionuclide transfer to the plants in terrestrial and semiaquatic areas on uranium mill talilings in the Bancroft, Elliot lake and Uranium City areas. This information is placed into an ecological context for the present and the future communities.  The specific objectives of this work are to arrive at estimates of mass transfer of radionuclides from the tailings to indigenous pionnering communities which have developed on inactive or abandoned uranium mill tailings sites in the past two decades.  These estimates are related to consumption by fauna, which may graze on these specific plants. A review of the ecological dynamics of the vegetation community and biogeochemical cycles on the waste sites is attempted to forecast long term trends."

        "description": [
            "Several old mine workings exist in the Upper Blackfoot river where operations started in the late eighteenth century and ceased in 1964. There has been concern about the possibility of effluents from these abandoned workings and mining wastes adversely affecting the surface water quality of the Blackfoot river. Accordingly, an investigation of the characteristics of the eff.luents \u00b7 from the Carbonate tailings pond and the portals of the Mike Horse and Anaconda mines was carried out. The composition of the waters leaving these potential sources of contamination was compared to the water characteristics in the Blackfoot river below the discharge point of the abandoned workings.  It was discovered that although the ore of these mines and part of the wastes are pyritic, the effluent contains very little acidity (40 mg/1 equivalent CaC03 in the Carbonate tailings pond: 60 mg/1 equivalent CaC03 in the Anaconda portal). As a result of contact with country rock and highly alkaline \u00b7waters in the drainage basin, all other waters sampled have alkalinity concentrations ranging from 32 to 98 mg/1 CaC03 \u2022 The sulphate concentrations in the portal effluents correspond closely to those expected for calcium and magnesium sulphate solubilities. The very low concentrations of iron found suggest that active acid mine drainage is no longer affecting the effluents. Furthermore, there are indications that  no relationship exists between the characteristics of the mine effluents and the water in the Upper Blackfoot river below the \r\nabandoned mine workings. Elevated concentrations of zinc and manganese are evident in the water in the immediate vicinity of the portals of the Mike Horse, the Anaconda and the associated waste dump. Environmental degradation of the water is limited to about 0.8 miles of Mike Horse creek and Beartrap creek between the Mike Horse and the Anaconda.  Natural cleansing processes take place in this affected portion of the creeks through the growth of attached algae which absorb and fix precipitate emerging from the portals. The Carbonate tailings area is partially colonized by indigenous vegetation cover which provides protection from oxygen, thereby curtailing extensive acid generation. If the aim is to improve the water quality of the Upper Blackfoot river, there is no justification for extensive reclamation measures, as any such activity could disturb the waste material. This may result in a new onset of acid generation which could adversely affect surface water quality. As well, earth moving activities may increase the suspended solids loading to the Blackfoot river. Any consideration of reclamation measures for aesthetic purposes must carefully incorporate the promotion and maintenance of the natural biological cleansing mechanisms which are presently in place."

The second. puts the heory into practice. \r\nPart A is the theory of titration analysis beginning with the basics of acid-base reactions and the definition of pH. Different types of titration analysis are discussed with a focus on neutralization titration, particularly acidity titrations. \r\nPart B is a discussion of the practical application of acidity titrations. Considered are both, titration curves done for water samples created in the laboratory and field water samples from 1995 and 1996, taken at South Bay. The water samples made in the lab contained various concentrations of metals such as iron. The case study explores the Mportance of acidity and the factors which influence it, affirming that pH does not define the acidity of a water sample. It is the metal concentration of the water sample which fluences the acidity of the water."

            "Both iron and phosphate, if they occur separately in the environment, can be the source of\r\nserious environmental problems. But since they have a strong chemical affinity for each\r\nother they normally tend to keep each other in check. Since iron is one of the major\r\ndrivers of acid generation many studies have explored the possibility of mixing various\r\nphosphate products, such as commercially-available fertilizer or dissolved phosphate\r\nsalts, with acid generating mine wastes to reduce or even eliminate acid mine drainage\r\n(Spotts and Dolhopf, 1992; Meek, 1991; Hart et al., 1990; Hart & Stiller, 1991;\r\nEvangelou, 1994; Ziemkiewicz, 1990; Yanful et al., 2000; Dey et al., 2000). In general,\r\nthe studies have concluded that while phosphate deployed in such a manner will\r\ndefinitely inhibit AMD, but that material and application costs make it economically\r\nimpractical.\r\nSince 1992 Boojum Research Limited has been conducting large scale field trials\r\nin which it has applied natural phosphate rock (NPR), a granular waste product of\r\nphosphate mines operated by Texas Gulf in North Carolina, to acid-generating mine\r\nwastes. These have demonstrated not only that phosphate works, but that it can provide\r\nan extremely economical solution to AMD; the trials have shown both that phosphate is\r\neffective in lower application rates as proposed by other workers, and also the phosphate\r\nis applied differently than previously suggested. It appears to be effective when it is\r\nmerely scattered onto the target area - either onto tailings deposits or on waste rock, or on\r\nacid-impacted sediments of lakes - rather than mechanically mixed into the waste stream.\r\nSince the material cost of NPR is negligible the only major expenditure associated with\r\nits use, is shipping. Accordingly, laboratory tests conducted by Boojum to determine the\r\nspecific chemical behaviour of the Texas Gulf North Carolina NPR, were enlarged to\r\ninclude NPR from mines in Ontario."

Since Texasgulf phosphate rock contains approximately 3.6 % fluorine by weight, the concentration of fluorine in Boomerang Lake could increase by no more than 3.6 mg/L in the event that all fluorine dissolved. The concentration increase is in the same order of magnitude of set guidelines and average background surface water concentrations. Fluoride toxicity, at these concentrations, to fish is unlikely."

Local sources of these materials must be identified, adequate supply guaranteed, and representative samples received before the biological treatability experiments can be performed and interpreted.

            "The bedrock depth in area immediately North of Mud Lake may vary from as deep as 20 m to very shallow level. The soil in the area consists of wet, organic rich, fine grain organic material, with possible addition of clay which underlines Mud Lake. \r\nVarious geophysical methods were reviewed as a possible techniques to investigate depth to bedrock in this area. Ground Penetrating Radar or Sledge-hammer Seismic investigations were initially proposed as tools to investigate depth of the bedrock in area located North of Mud Lake. The penetration depth of the Ground Penetrating Radar system is dependent upon the effective conductivity and dielectric constant of the earth material being probed. Previous electromagnetic EM34-3 surveys in the area indicated relatively high soil conductivity, possibility of the presence of clay material, and conductive surface water. Based on these information Ground Penetrating Radar would have relatively small depth of penetration in the northern portion of Mud Lake. However it may provide satisfactory results in area of gravel pit and in areas adjacent to bedrock outcrops. \r\nSeismic method appears to be the most suitable and accurate geophysical method in this type of investigations, however sledge hammer or other mechanical devices used as an energy source seem to be too weak in area of very soft, organic rich and wet soils. To investigate depth up to 20 m in above described conditions dynamite would have to be used as a sufficient source of energy. This would cause disturbance of sensitive soft soils leading to a possible cross contamination of the subsurface. \r\nDue to above concerns the time domain electromagnetic (TEM) soundings or resistivity method using direct current (DC soundings) remained available techniques to investigate depth to bedrock in area North of Mud Lake. Since DC soundings can not be conducted in frozen ground and in the presence of substantial snow cover the TEM soundings were chosen to be conducted during this project."

            "The South Bay Waste Management Area (SBWMA) is located in Northern Ontario,\r\napproximately 85 km north east of Ear Falls (51o 08N, 92o 40E). A zinc and copper mine\r\nwas operated on the site from 1970 to 1981. The mine, the site of the former mill, a waste\r\nrock pile and the tailings are all located on a peninsula within the watershed of\r\nConfederation Lake, an important fishing lake with hunting lodges in the English River\r\ndrainage basin. In fact, the former mine site is virtually surrounded by a chain of tributary\r\nlakes which feed Confederation \u2013 Boomerang Lake (1M m3) to the south which flows\r\ndirectly into Confederation, and Mud Lake (0.07M m3) and Lena Lake ( 0.7Mm3) to the\r\nnorth and northwest which flow to Confederation by way of Armanda Lake (1 M m 3).\r\nBoomerang Lake was contaminated during the life of the mine, and Mud Lake was\r\ncontaminated in 1994 by a groundwater plume moving from the tailings. Both have been\r\ndesignated as part of the SBWMA and have been utilized in the clean-up effort. .\r\nDecommissioning activities, undertaken immediately after the closure of the mine,\r\nconsisted of burying the portal and sealing the shaft, raises and caps. All buildings were\r\ndestroyed - except for the concrete foundations that were left in place - and the\r\ncontaminated building materials buried except for those materials subsequently used in\r\nthe restoration. The tailings were covered in gravel to a depth of one foot and revegetated.\r\nThese efforts had no effect on the generation of acidity and contaminants. A\r\n1986 environmental study noted that acidic plumes were leaving the site and\r\nrecommended that they be treated by the occasional liming of Boomerang Lake, a\r\nproposal that was not accepted. In 1986, Boojum Research Limited was invited to assess\r\nthe potential applications of ecological engineering at the SBWMA and the site has thus\r\nbecome a demonstration site of this decommissioning approach.\r\nThe SBWMA contains two distinct contaminant-generating areas; the Mine/Mill Site and\r\nthe tailings basin. Measures taken at the SBWMA have substantially reduced the\r\nmobilization of contaminants on the site, and redirected all contaminants into two major\r\ncontaminant sinks, Boomerang Lake and Mud Lake. Mass balances are presented below\r\nfor the contaminants mobilized on-site and captured by the sinks. The noted retention of\r\ntons of contaminants provides a measure of the effectiveness of the effort to date."

            "In pyritic mining wastes, the release and subsequent oxidation of Fe(II) from mining sites\r\nmay produce non-negligible amounts of high sulfate and extremely low pH waters. The\r\nresulting acid mine drainage (AMD) may be divided into three types:\r\n\u2022 iron sulfide oxidation,\r\n\u2022 dissolution of soluble iron sulfate minerals, and\r\n\u2022 the dissolution of less soluble sulfate minerals of the alunite-jarosite series.\r\nThe oxidation of iron sulfide minerals such as pyrite (FeS2) and pyrrhotite is responsible for\r\nthe majority of acid production from mining wastes. In addition to metals, acid, sulfate is also\r\nreleased to ground and surface water. If sulfate is present in higher concentrations a variety\r\nof iron minerals may form, i.e.: jarosite (XFe3(SO4)2(OH)6, (X being a monovalent cation)\r\n\u2022 Schwertmannite (Fe8O8(OH)6SO4). These secondary minerals are not stable and the release of sulfate by dissolution of these\r\nminerals may result in the formation of Fe(III) hydroxides with subsequent acid (H+\r\n) release.\r\nSecondary mineral formation, with hydrogen-ion generation leading to pH values as low as\r\npH 1, was reported in stored South Bay tailings pore water. Investigations on the secondary\r\nmineral phases, along with microbial investigations, were carried out and Schwertmannite\r\nminerals were detected as reported in Kalin, 2003, \"The acid generation potential of iron\r\nprecipitates and their sludge in Decommissioning with Ecological Engineering\". This is a\r\nmatter of some concern, given the high number of hydrogen ions, generated by the formation\r\nof Schwertmannite, The natural precipitation of stable, iron-hydroxide sludge, which is not a\r\nsource of acidity, is an important component of the Ecological Engineering\r\ndecommissioning approach. Thus Schwertmannite formation is undesirable, and the\r\nconditions under which it occurs must well understood. Samples of sludge were collected\r\nfrom relevant locations at the South Bay site for an investigation into the formation of this\r\nsecondary mineral."

            "The final report for the year 1998 consists of summary statements supported by data collected in the system. The Biological Polishing process selected for the Buchans waste water is based on the water chemistry of the mine waste effluents, and not on the biology. In fact, as the project developed over the past decade, the biological component of the waste water treatment process became relatively small. The algae/moss growth in the polishing ponds only serves two functions. The first function is to provide surface area for particulate collection, and the second function is to shift the distribution of the forms of inorganic carbon towards carbonate for zinc carbonate precipitation. Therefore, the waste water treatment has focused, over all these years, on the water chemistry."

            "This project focuses on the treatment and amelioration of acid mine drainage (AMD) from mining wastes using natural microbial processes which occur in wetlands and sediments. Conceptually this should be possible, as acid-generation is a natural process and the stabilizing reactions which are alkalinity-generation, should also occur in nature.  Since 1986, experiments have been carried out in AMD water, with the aim to determine which conditions will produce alkalinity generation. Sufficiently encouraging data had been assembled by 1988 to formulate the basis of MEND project 3.11.1: Treatment of Acidic Seepage Employing Wetland Ecology and Microbiology, funded by INCO, Environment Canada, Energy Mines and Resources and Denison Mines Limited. The main objective of this project is to determine the key design parameters for Acid Reduction Using Microbiology or the ARUM process within 4 years.  This report summarizes the data obtained in various field and laboratory experiments since 1988. It describes the construction and development of the test cell system in which, through flow control, the relationships between amendment quantity, flow rates and seepage characteristics are being tested. Precipitate formation is studied and its accumulation is quantified. Cattail growth is studied under highly acidic conditions and the alkalinity-generation in severe AMD is tested.  The key conclusions to date are, that microbial alkalinity-generation has been initiated in the ARUMATORS and has prevailed in the lower parts of test cells with amendment curtains at low flow conditions. Data are presented which demonstrate that acidity in AMD water has been replaced by alkalinity. The test cell system is functional. Low flow conditions of 3-5 L/min have been maintained for long periods, and the system has handled maximum flows in excess of 300 L/min. The relationship between the quantity of amendment and the onset of the ARUM process at low flow conditions is being tested during the remainder of the 1990 season. With data produced to date, it was possible to define the basic configuration which is required for a functional ARUM AMD treatment system."

            "The Ecological Engineering approach to decommissioning mine sites, which has been applied at\r\nthe South Bay Waste Management Area (SBWMA), takes advantage of a number of naturallyoccurring\r\nprocesses to correct problems associated with acid mine drainage. One of these natural\r\nprocesses is to allow the formation of iron precipitates to occur without adding neutralisation\r\nchemicals such as lime as this requires the maintenance of a chemical treatment plant, often in\r\nperpetuity. Such plants produce, as a secondary waste, a sludge containing high metal\r\nconcentrations, which needs disposal.\r\nFor South Bay, a former Cu/Zn Mine with tailings and underground workings producing AMD,\r\nnatural sludge production is estimated to be about 30 m\r\n3 annually. The estimated sludge\r\nproduction for a high-density treatment plant would generate about 1,200m3 of sludge per year,\r\nincluding spent lime, while a general treatment plant would generate 3000 m3 per year (Kalin,\r\n2001). The tailings consist of 41 % pyrite and 4 % pyrrhotite and are expected to generate AMD\r\nfor anywhere between 1000 to 35,000 years. From an economic and environmental viewpoint the\r\nEcological Engineering technology developed at this site in the last 15 years should not be\r\ndismissed without careful consideration. Ecological Engineering integrates natural iron -\r\nprecipitation, alkalinity generation by microbes and biological polishing along with measures to\r\nreduce the rates of acid generation. The objective of this report is to summarize the acidification associated with iron precipitation\r\nwhich occurs in the discharge of contaminated ground water seepages. It will address precipitate\r\nformation in mine working discharges to the Backfill Raise Ditch (BRD), in the relevant water\r\nbodies of the SBWMA, which include Boomerang and Mud Lakes which have been utilized as\r\npolishing ponds and Armanda Lake, inadvertently acidified by effluent from Mud Lake."

            "Wood ash has long been recognized as a valuable and safe additive to\r\nagricultural soils. Composed primarily of calcium- and potassium-oxides, it also\r\ncontains major and minor elements common in the environment and yet essential\r\nto plant growth. Field and greenhouse research have shown that it has a liming\r\neffect of up to 90% of the total neutralizing power of lime. Almost by definition,\r\nsince ash is derived from the combustion of clean and virgin woods, it is not\r\noffensive to the environment.\r\nIn summer 2000, 4 t of wood ash, generated in Ear Falls by Weyerhaeuser sawmill, was\r\napplied on an experimental basis to the slopes of the recently enlarged Backfill-Raise\r\nDitch at the Abandoned South Bay Mine Site, which provides a pathway for seepages\r\nfrom the underground workings. Lacking a ground cover, the contaminated slopes were\r\nvulnerable to erosion. Experiments in the previous year, with one truck load of wood-ash\r\nindicated that the wood ash would both raise the pH of the waste rock, and provide\r\nnutrients to stimulate the growth of a terrestrial moss. In fact, this was accomplished. The\r\nresulting carpets of moss in the cracks between the rocks stabilized the ground and\r\nreduced the infiltration of the contaminated run-off into the waste rock of the mill site.\r\nDuring the summer of 2001, with the approval of the MOE, approximately 100 tonnes of\r\nwood ash were spread over Mill Pond, Mine site and on the Backfill Raise ditch slopes.\r\nThe results will be documented by fall 2002 but so far are very promising.\r\n Concurrent with those terrestrial experiments, in May 2000, wood ash was added to\r\nsamples of acidic water taken from Mud Lake and Boomerang Lake, both of which lie\r\nwithin the waste management area. The pH of Mud Lake is presently at 2.5; Boomerang\r\nLake is 3.0. The object of the experiment in two 1 m3\r\n containers was to determine the\r\namount of wood ash required to raise the pH to 4.5, at which level phytoplankton and\r\nmicrobial activity accelerate, to counteract acidification and promote biological\r\npolishing, mainly for the removal of zinc.\r\nWood ash has two reaction components; it contains potassium oxide (1.6 % wt/wt),\r\nwhich reacts immediately, and calcium oxide (11.4 % wt/wt), which settles with the\r\nremaining inert materials in the ash, which is about 80% by weight, to the sediment of the\r\nlake to be treated. From there it gradually releases its neutralizing capacity."

            "Mining companies face world-wide environmental challenges in finding sustainable solutions to decommissioning mine waste management areas.  Within areas needing restoration (open pits, acidified lakes, tailings and sludge ponds), ecological engineering techniques can be used in mine water bodies in order to retain contaminants, thereby reducing their loads to the receiving aquatic environment.  Phytoplankton communities in such water bodies, so-called \u201cBiological Polishing Systems\u201d, play significant roles in primary production, metal-removal, overall water quality improvement, and biological monitoring.  This study defines the structure of phytoplankton communities and their controlling factors in several mine water bodies.  The findings relate water quality to phytoplankton presence, shedding new light on biological monitoring approaches and discusses some implications of eco-toxicity."

            "Of primary importance in this work was the identification of the locations of uranium mill tailings, or any wastes containing long-lived radionuclides around Port Radium. On the peninsula, depressions were utilized initially for waste disposal during the uranium mining era, as for example Radium Lake and Murphy Lake. Radium Lake has been covered for some time with waste rock and overburden. Since the closure of the silver mine in May 1982, Echo Bay Mines Ltd. has undertaken the covering of most of Murphy Lake with waste rock. The West Adit Tailings Area was the only area identified on land where wastes from the uranium milling operation have collected but remain uncovered. Minor amounts of uranium tailings are found on the rock slope above West Adit and in the spillway of Murphy Creek. About one million tons of uranium mill tailings have been discharged into Murphy Bay, via Murphy Creek and down the slope of West Adit."

            "Research at the University of Toronto and Boojum Research has focused on\r\nassessing the feasibility of an in situ BIOremediation of Mine Area Groundwater\r\nInorganic Contamination (BIOMAGIC) process for South Bay, and elsewhere. It is a\r\njoint project, supported by NRC ( the National Research Council of Canada) and has two\r\ncomponents. The theoretical work is carried out at U. of Toronto, under contract from\r\nBoojum Research and the company carries out the field work, with field tests and scale\r\nup. The concept is based on using urea-degrading bacteria to increase the pH and\r\nalkalinity of acidic groundwater containing high concentrations of dissolved metals. This\r\nis intended not only to reduce the extent of acidification that normally accompanies the\r\nhydrolysis of dissolved metals in mine drainage, particularly ferric iron, but also to\r\ninitiate the removal of dissolved metals through mineral precipitation and sorption\r\nreactions. Anticipated benefits include restoration of normal pH values and substantially\r\nreduced metal-loading in water that is apt to move off mine site property. Moreover, urea\r\nis produced as a bulk commodity agricultural fertilizer that is readily available.\r\n The approach used in this preliminary evaluation of the potential use of ureadegrading\r\nbacteria for BIOMAGIC involved both geochemical modeling and \r\n2\r\nmicrobiological investigations. Flow-through column work has also been undertaken to\r\nhelp in the assessment of South Bay hydrogeology, and to learn about the potential\r\nimpact of bacteria on groundwater flow in porous geological media. Construction of the\r\ngeochemical model using the MINEQL+ program was based on South Bay groundwater\r\nchemistry provided by Boojum Research. The objective of the modeling exercise was to\r\ndetermine (i) the extent to which groundwater pH would change in response to urea\r\ndegradation, (ii) the minimum amount of urea that must be degraded to restore nearneutral\r\npH, and (iii) the impact of anticipated pH changes on the aqueous chemistry and\r\nsolubility of dissolved metals. Microbiological studies initially encompassed a survey of\r\nSouth Bay groundwaters to determine whether any urea-degrading bacteria existed in the\r\nmine site aquifer, and to identify specific locations with conditions favorable to their\r\ngrowth. Subsequent work involved single colony isolation of South Bay urea-degrading\r\nbacteria to compare their activity with that of a reference bacterial culture (Bacillus\r\npasturii) from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These pure culture\r\nstudies are being done under anaerobic conditions in South Bay groundwater. All of this\r\nmicrobiological information is needed to determine where to initiate BIOMAGIC, and\r\nwhether natural populations of bacteria might be used or, alternatively, whether a need\r\nexists to add urea-degrading bacteria to the groundwater system."

            "The experimental use of wood ash produced by the Ear Fall saw mill as an amendment\r\nof tailings/rock mixtures along the Backfill raise ditch and on Mill pond was tested during\r\ngrowing season 2000. Very good growth was obtained with the addition of the material\r\non the seeded plots. It's use as part of reclamation efforts appears of acid mine\r\ndrainage sites appears dictated given the need for reusing/recycling wastes rather than\r\nlandfill.\r\nWith this philosophy in mind the material was also used to test its effects of both\r\nBoomerang and Mud Lake. We have found that in the laboratory, in test containers and\r\nin enclosures in the lakes themselves, the wood ash has had a beneficial effect on lake\r\nwater chemistry. The wood ash has increased PU and decreased metal acidity.\r\nHowever as a water treatment the application levels are relatively high as the particles\r\nsink quickly to the sediment. Its neutralization capacity in the sediments is being tested\r\nin lake. Based on short term experiments we would probably need to add between 430\r\nto 860 tones of wood waste to Boomerang Lake, and/or additional 215 tones to Mud\r\nLake to reach a water pH of 4.0. The long-term neutralization to the sediment is\r\nunderdetermined yet. At these application levels we were concerned about effects on\r\nsediment and in turn the lake biota, especially the moss cover on the lake bottom.\r\nHowever at the lower end of these application rates, the plants appeared normal. At\r\nhigh application rates, the plants were detrimentally affected. Finally, the concentration\r\nof metals added by the wood waste is negligible compared to the metal content of both\r\nlakes. The test in Boomerang Lake enclosures to use the wood-ash as sediment\r\namendment are ongoing and we hope we obtain permission to continue."

            "Talisman Energy Inc. (Talisman) is responsible for maintenance and monitoring at the South Bay mine in northwest Ontario. This underground copper and zinc mine was operated from 1971 to 1981 and was subsequently decommissioned in the mid-1980's. Talisman is currently utilizing 'ecological engineering' to neutralize acid mine drainage (AMD) from the former mine area. Modeling predicts that AMD will continue for a minimum of 1,000 years and a maximum of 36,000 years (Kalin 1994). \r\nWater quality monitoring conducted for Talisman indicates that acid discharge and heavy metals are reaching nearby Confederation Lake in both surface and groundwater (Kalin 1994). Representatives from the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy (MOEE), Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), and Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) are concerned that this input could have long term or chronic effects. Prior monitoring has focused on biophysical conditions on the former mine site, and on the chemical composition of AMD discharges. Available data do not allow definition of the chemical or biological zone of influence of South Bay Mine discharges on Confederation Lake, nor do they help determine whether Confederation Lake is being stressed by one or more disturbances. \r\nSalmo Consulting Inc. was asked to design a cooperative aquatic monitoring program to:                                  \r\n1.\tdefine the zone of influence of mine discharges;\r\n2.\tdifferentiate effects from other potential disturbance sources; and\r\n3.\tdetermine whether Confederation Lake is being stressed by mine discharge .                                         This report summarizes aquatic monitoring data collected in the South Bay mine area to address these objectives. Data sources include earlier studies conducted by MNR, MOEE, and consultants to Talisman, and water quality, sediment chemistry, benthic invertebrate, and phytoplankton data collected in August, 1995. \r\nSection 1 describes the biophysical setting of the South Bay mine and summarizes historical monitoring and biophysical information. Methods used during the August 1995 sampling program are given in Section 2. Aquatic ecosystem information for Confederation Lake and the three AMD discharge areas is provided in Section 3. Section 3.1 reviews historical and August 1995 water quality, sediment chemistry, benthic invertebrate, and phytoplankton data for Confederation Lake and discusses overall health of the lake and its three sub-basins. Similar data specific to the Boomerang Lake, Mill Bay, and Mud Lake AMD discharge areas are presented in Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, respectively. Each section begins with a review of the AMD discharge characteristics, reviews monitoring data, and discusses the observed zone of influence. Section 4 summarizes information from Confederation Lake and the three AMD discharge areas and provides conclusions for the three monitoring objectives identified above."

            "South Bay Mine is located 50 miles east of Red Lake in the Uchi\u00adConfederation greenstone belt. \r\nThe deposit was discovered in 1968 by airborne geophysics and went into production in early 1971. Production since that time has averaged 500 tons per day, from reserves of l ,600,000 tons (including past production) averaging 2.3% copper, 14.5% zinc and 3.5 oz./ton silver. These reserves extend to the 1500 foot level with underground exploration continuing at deeper levels. \r\nSouth Bay belongs to the family of stratiform base metals massive sulphide deposits associated with felsic volcanic rocks. It occurs \r\nnear the top of the youngest of three mafic to felsic volcanic cycles identified in the area. \r\nThe ore horizon overlies quartz feldspar porphyry. The quartz feldspar porphyry thickens in the area of the mine where it probably formed the core of a rising felsic dome. The porphyry is believed to have intrusive and extrusive phases. \r\nThe ore lenses, 5-70 feet wi\udbc0\udc17e,contain massive fine pyrite, \r\nbanded to interstitial chalcopyrite, and finely banded to coarse massive sphalerite. Sulphides constitute 70-95% of the ore, the balance being quartz, carbonate, chlorite, chert, and argillite. The highly irreg\u00adular ore lenses occur along a strike length of up to 700 feet. The \r\nupper portions of some of the ore zones are zinc rich, reflecting original metal zoning. Argillite underlying and intercalated with \r\nthese sulphide bodies indicate quiescent conditions of deposition. Elsewhere, preconsolidation slumping has destroyed any zoning. Primary textures of sphalerite and chalcopyrite have been largely destroyed by dynamic and thermal metamorphism. \r\nThe hanging wall consists of 70-300 feet of dacite breccia, in \r\nturn overlain by rhyolite. Irregular felsic dikes commonly intrude the ore zone and enclosing rocks. The dominant alterati0n consists of chloritization and brecciation of the quartz feldspar porphyry to depths of 50-300 feet below the ore, and chloritization in the hanging wall dacite breccia. It is believed that the wall rock alteration and mineralization resulted from the sa\udbc0\udc3de event.",

            "Sulfates produced by oxidation of sulfide minerals in mines, mine-and-mill tailings, and waste-rock dumps are characterized by (1) 634S values similar to those of the original sulfide minerals, and (2) low or negative 51ao values similar to those for sulfates in acidic spring waters. Experimental oxidation of pyrite in waters with a wide range of 51ao values has shown that the 51ao value of the product sulfate depends not only on the experimental conditions (aerobic or anaerobic; submerged or intermittently wet and dry; sterile or containing Thiobacillus ferrooxidans), which may determine the actual reaction pathways, but also on the initial 6180 value of the water in which the oxidation takes place. The experimental results can be interpreted as evidence that 29 to 100% of the oxygen in the sulfate was derived from water molecules, whereas dissolved sulfates in field samples incorporated 35 to 90% water oxygen. So far it has not been possible to determine whether the water oxygen is incorporated into the sulfate during the actual oxidation process (implied by proposed stoichiometric equations), or through oxygen-isotope exchange between the water and one or more intermediates (e.g. thiosulfate or sulfite). At room temperature, the exchange of oxygen isotopes between water and sulfate ions is too slow to effect the observed 51ao values. The range in 51ao values for sulfate produced by oxidation of sulfides tends to widen as 618 0 values for rain and snow become more negative at higher latitudes and at greater distances from the oceans. Some uncertainty still exists regarding the actual 5100 value for dissolved oxygen in subsurface waters. A further complication is background sulfate from sources such as marine evaporites, which might be detected using sulfur isotope data. The above components must be characterized before proper interpretation of the oxygen-isotope composition of sulfate produced during sulfide weathering is possible. Only then could oxygen-isotope data be used to monitor the effects of measures designed to reduce (or accelerate) the oxidation process in mines, tailings deposits, and waste-rock dumps."

            "Ecological Engineering as a decommissioning technology for acid-generating waste\r\nmaterial from base metal mine sites is being developed on a site in northern Ontario. A\r\nzinc/copper concentrator operated 65 km northeast of Ear Falls for 10 years, producing\r\nabout 760,000 short tons of tailings, covering 20 ha, and containing 41 % pyrite and 4 %\r\npyrrhotite. The tailings are situated above a lake which has acidified during the life of the\r\nmine.\r\nSince 1986 the site has been investigated intensively. This report represents the last\r\ndetailed investigation of the hydrology and geochemistry, concentrating on the oxidation\r\nand iron precipitation rates which occur in the tailings mass. These rates define the rate\r\nat which the contaminants are released. The released contaminants entering the acidified\r\nlake are removed in this Ecological Engineered system mainly by different groups of\r\nattached algae. A literature review was carried out to provide a technical framework for\r\nbiological removal processes taking place on the site. Water samples collected from piezometers in 1990 were used to confirm that several precipitation processes could take place in the tailings mass or in the surface water\r\nreceiving AMD seepage. All piezometer samples show super-saturation with respect to several iron minerals, including ferric hydroxides, aoethite, hematite, letidocrocite, and maanetite, which may be precipitated. Super-saturation with respect to iarosite is shown only by samples from 2 piezometers and Mill Pond.\r\nSamples from piezometers M4 and M10 (and from Mill Pond and Boomerang Landing)\r\nshow super-saturation with respect to several aluminum minerals, including alunite, boehmite, diawore, gibbsite, and several clay minerals.\r\nSamples from piezometers M7B, MI 0, M25, M30, M47, M55, Mill Pond, and Dave's Dam\r\nshow super-saturation with respect to quartz; those from M7B, MI 0, and M47 also show\r\nsuper-saturation with respect to gypsum.\r\nRevised sulphide-oxidation rates for the South Bay tailings range from 0.0001 to 0.0427 mol.kg\" .yi' (overall average 0.0033 mol.kg-'.yi'). Revised Fe-precipitation rates range\r\nfrom 0.000009 to 0.001 135 mol.kg-'.yr-' (overall average 0.00025 mol.kg-'.yr-').\r\nThe literature review on periphytic algae indicated that algal growth rate data in acidic\r\nmetal rich waters are scarce. However, the tolerance mechanisms of periphytic algal\r\ngroups which facilitate growth and metal removal from the water were evident.\r\nExtracellular carbon in the form of sheaths or jelly is produced in response to metal and\r\nacid stress by the algal population. Extracellular carbon production is not only related to\r\nmetal and acid stress, but also to low nutrients (P and N) in the water or plants. It was concluded that periphytic algae, given their biological polishing characteristics, will indeed prove to be an important contaminant removal process within the Ecological Engineering technology. Research is required to define the conditions which facilitate growth of periphytic algae, and which of the contaminant removal processes (biosieving,\r\nuptake, ad/absorption) is the main contaminant removal process. With this information,\r\npredictions on the contaminant removal capacity of the system can be made. With the\r\ncontaminant release rates determined here, the overall effectiveness of biological\r\npolishing as a process can be determined."

            "Decommissioning acid generating mining waste generally requires perpetual lime\r\ntreatment. South Bay Mine, a copper/zinc operation active between 1971 and 1981,\r\ngenerated 0.75 million tonnes of tailings with a pyrite content of 41 YO and a pyrrhotite\r\ncontent of 4 %. It is located 85 km northeast of Ear Falls in northwestern Ontario. Acid\r\ngeneration, based on the sulphur content, is expected to continue for a minimum of\r\n1,110 years and a maximum of 35,742 years. Oxidation rates in the tailings range from 76,000 mol Fe a-\u2019 to 32,452,000 mol Fe a-I.\r\nPerpetual lime treatment, although environmentally and economically unattractive, has\r\nremained the conventional approach. The option of using Ecological Engineering for\r\nthe decommissioning of the site was assessed through a feasibility study in 1986. Ecological Engineering uses ecological principles to reconstruct ecosystems within the\r\nwaste management area. These ecosystems, through their natural water cleansing\r\ncapacity, transfer the annual contaminant loadings from water to sediments. Hydrogeological studies identified the main ground water flow paths from the tailings\r\nto Confederation Lake, and from the minelmill site to Boomerang Lake. Ground water\r\nplumes and seepage paths were intercepted with diversion ditches, constructed on both\r\nthe mine site and from the tailings, and directed to Boomerang Lake. Boomerang Lake\r\nwas relegated to become the main polishing pond or treatment area for water from the\r\nmine site and the southern and western ground water plumes from the tailings. Decant\r\nPond, on the tailings, also became a biological polishing pond. Natural contaminant removal processes used in Ecological Engineering includes\r\nbiological polishing for zinc and iron. Attached periphyton on brush and other\r\nsubstrates adsorb, co-precipitate, and sequester metals. ARUM (Acid Reduction Using\r\nMicrobiology) is used for removal of sulphate and acidity. Microbial communities in\r\nchemically reducing sediments facilitate this process. ARUM was initiated in Decant Pond in 1992, as both a physical and reducing (redox)\r\nbarrier on the western beach, the entry point for acidic run-off and contaminated ground\r\nwater. This process has been quantified for scale-up, through continued joint R&D,\r\nsupported by CANMET, MEND and other mining companies. Biological polishing was scaled up gradually, by annually increasing the surface area\r\nfor periphyton growth. In Boomerang Lake this was done through additions of brush\r\ncuttings, whereas in Decant Pond, inert demolishing material was used to provide\r\nsurface area for algal growth. In Mill Pond, the basin which contributes the largest\r\ncontaminant loadings to Boomerang Lake, organic material was introduced, thereby\r\nassisting metal adsorption, ARUM and Biological polishing and overall reducing\r\nloadings to Boomerang Lake. From the Biological polishing studies, the contaminant removal rates and estimates of\r\nthe required surface area for periphyton growth were determined. If a substrate mass\r\nwith a surface area three times that of the lake bottom was added, biological polishing\r\nalone could remove 40 % of the annual loading of zinc, and 100 % of the iron. In Mill\r\nPond, 100 % + of the annual loadings of zinc and iron could be retained, thereby\r\nreducing the overall contaminant load to Boomerang Lake. Ecological Engineering\r\nmeasures were implemented gradually and all measures taken at the site have resulted\r\nin a average zinc concentration of 7.6 mg L-' in 1992. Using monitoring data for\r\nBoomerang Lake, extrapolations indicate that, had no Ecological Engineering measures\r\nbeen implemented, zinc concentrations in the lake would likely have risen well above\r\ncurrent levels. Performance characteristics of the Biological polishing system are derived from the\r\ngrowth data, obtained in the field and the laboratory. The ranges in expected\r\nperformance are large, mainly due to the limitations of methodologies for determining\r\ngrowth rates. In field experiments, growth can only be calculated using linear\r\ninterpolation between two biomass measurements, which does not represent natural\r\ngrowth patterns. Furthermore, biomass which had accumulated on branches up until\r\nthe time of sampling does not include that biomass which had sloughed off over the\r\nperiod since the last sampling time. While laboratory experiments examining periphyton\r\ngrowth demonstrated logarithmic growth, it was also apparent from these experiments\r\nthat the waste water chemistry changes in the experimental vessel. Therefore, there\r\nare limitations during projection of laboratory-derived growth rates to arrive at estimates of Biological polishing performance in the field.  Decant Pond water quality is variable due to seasonal changes in run-off flow volumes.\r\nDuring periods of exceptionally high precipitation in spring and fall, elevated zinc\r\nconcentrations are present. The monitoring data suggest that periphyton growing in\r\nDecant Pond effectively remove the zinc loading during the summer growing season.\r\nLong-term trends in water quality measured in Boomerang Lake suggest that acidity\r\nand sulphate have steadily increased. Sedimentation studies indicate that iron,\r\nprecipitated as solids and settled to the sediment surface, is periodically re-suspended\r\nin the lake.\r\nIn 1992, work addressing the residual contaminant loading in Boomerang Lake, Mill\r\nPond, and Decant Pond was initiated. Processes, including ARUM and Biological\r\npolishing, are capable of removing the annual loadings, but cannot remove the entire\r\ncontaminant loading which has accumulated during the estimated residence time of 3\r\nyears in Boomerang Lake.\r\nPhosphate rock consumes acidity and precipitates metals. Any remaining (excess)\r\ndissolved phosphate, a major plant nutrient, is consumed by the periphyton population.\r\nExperimental trials using different grades of this material were first performed in the laboratory, followed by field trials. When phosphate sand (750 kg) was applied to Mill\r\nPond, significant amounts iron and aluminum were precipitated.\r\nPhosphate powder (9 tonnes) was applied to areas around the northwest end of\r\nBoomerang Lake. While iron and aluminum concentrations in the surface waters were\r\nunaffected, concentrations of these elements decreased in bottom water overlying the\r\nsediments. The concentrations of metal precipitates increased in these sediments.\r\nBased on the increases in metals in the sediments following phosphate rock\r\napplication, it was estimated that 6 % of the zinc, 74 % of the iron, and 10 % of the\r\naluminum in the lake water were relegated to the sediment.\r\nIn 1992, five tonnes of coarse phosphate rock was applied to an area of the tailings where AMD was ponding due to the high water levels. In water leaving the area\r\ntreated with phosphate rock, iron concentrations decreased from 53.5 to 12.9 mg L-'\r\nand aluminum decreased from 34.3 to 5.2 mg L-', immediately following phosphate rock\r\napplication.\r\nFull implementation of Ecological Engineering measures has not yet been completed  at the site. However, the extensive site-specific data set, and the progress made in\r\ntechnology development, facilitated an overall mass balance of annual contaminant\r\nloadings to Boomerang Lake and contaminant removal processes (Biological polishing\r\nand ARUM).\r\nThe annual loadings of zinc, iron, sulphur, and hydrogen ions to Boomerang Lake are\r\n3.9, 2.7, 16, and 0.1 tonnes, respectively. The estimated annual zinc and iron removal\r\ncapacity, when full implementation of the Biological polishing ecosystem in Boomerang\r\nLake is complete, is 5 tonnes and 2.7 tonnes, respectively. The estimated annual\r\nremoval capacity of ARUM (in Boomerang Lake sediments), based on sulphate\r\nreduction rates and alkalinity generation measured in other field systems, is 15.7 t of\r\nsulphur and 0.09 t of hydrogen ions.\r\nEcological Engineering measures for the South Bay site have targeted contaminant generation by the tailings deposit, surface water loadings to Decant Pond, and surface\r\nwater loadings by the mill site. The potential of the underground workings to produce\r\nseepages draining to Confederation Lake during years with high run-off was not\r\naddressed until 1992. A large diversion ditch was completed in January 1993. Its\r\nperformance and the effects on Boomerang Lake will be monitored in 1993. Work\r\naddressing ARUM activity in Boomerang Lake sediments and on the tailings beach of\r\nDecant Pond will continue. The accumulated contaminant load in Boomerang Lake, Mill Pond and Decant Pond will be addressed using phosphate rock."

            "As a part of 1993 scope of work, the hydrogeological conditions of the tailing site were\r\nre-evaluated. It was concluded that some groundwater is not reporting as expected to\r\nthe diversion ditch and, therefore, may be leaving the tailings drainage basin in the N-W\r\ndirection towards the Mud Lake. Mud Lake had been monitored outside the regulatory\r\nrequirements intermittently since 1988. Generally, the pH was around 7.5, the\r\nconductivity of 430 pS.cm-\u2018 and the water free of contaminants. Given the disparity in the water balance for the tailings drainage basin, in March of 1994 water samples were collected in Mud Lake through the ice. The pH had dropped to 5.3 and the conductivity had risen to 1,430 pS.cm\u201d (Table 1). No surface flow of\r\ncontaminated water has been located. These results confirmed that contaminated\r\ngroundwater was entering Mud Lake. Upon completion of spring run-off, the dissolved\r\niron in Mud Lake water had oxidized and hydrolysed, and the pH of Mud Lake dropped\r\nto pH 3.1 by April, 1994. In August, 1994, the pH was 2.7. The data collected during the March 1994 sampling campaign clearly indicated water quality problems in Mud Lake. A second field trip was organized in April, 1994. Top and bottom water samples were taken in Mud Lake. The data indicated that the entire\r\nwater body was contaminated with zinc. The conductivity of bottom water samples\r\nwere generally higher than surface water samples. Given that Mud Lake is shallow,\r\nand well mixed by wind-driven circulation during the ice-free season, this suggested\r\nthat the seepages are emerging from the bottom of the lake through the sediments.  This report documents the background information on Mud Lake and the investigations performed in 1994 so to gain an overall understanding of the seepage path. This site specific information is then placed in the broader context of the decommissioning objectives for the South Bay Mine site. Ecological Engineering, a low-maintenance\r\napproach to close-out, was chosen for this site, as the tailings represents an environmental liability for a very long period. Since the results from ongoing research and the gradual scale-up were promising, the property has been returned to the Crown with the provision that no contaminated seepages discharge into Confederation Lake. In Section 2 of this report, the historic data of the Mud Lake drainage basin are\r\nsummarized, and contaminant loadings from the basin are estimated. In Section 3, the\r\nseepage pathways are defined through preliminary geophysical surveys and test\r\ndrilling. In Section 4, the various approaches to achieving the overall objective are\r\noutlined to provide a framework for selecting the implementation steps for the\r\ndecommissioning approach. The rationale for the decommissioning approach will be\r\ncomplete upon, first, review of these approaches; second, selection of the final\r\napproach; third, development of an action plan for the steps towards implementation."

            "The water quality data for Confederation Lake do not suggest a deterioration. Although\r\nthe discharge from Boomerang Lake at station C1 was high during spring run-off in\r\n1994, by the end of the year, the concentrations were similar to those reported for 1992.\r\nThis reduction can be potentially accounted for by the phosphate rock application\r\ncarried out in 1993 and 1994 in Boomerang Lake. Further applications of fine ground\r\nphosphate rock are planned for 1995 to counteract the slow, but steady, acidification of\r\nBoomerang Lake.\r\nThe Backfill Raise Diversion Ditch has reduced the contaminant loading to\r\nConfederation Lake from the surface seepages significantly. The bottom water at\r\nstation C8 shows higher concentrations of zinc than the surface water. Electromagnetic\r\nsurveys have established that a seepage enters Confederation Lake at a depth of about\r\n6 m at the Mill site. The effects of the diversion ditch, in terms of stopping the deep\r\nseepage discharge, are more difficult to quantify. A slower response by the\r\ngroundwater flow regime to hydrogeological modifications can be anticipated, compared\r\nto more rapid surface water seepage responses. Monitoring will continue in 1995 and\r\nremedial actions will be developed.\r\nThe hydrological reevaluation of the perched tailings area carried out in 1993 leads to\r\nthe conclusion that, with changes in the geochemical and hydrological conditions in the\r\ntailings, permeability and flows leaving the tailings area can change correspondingly.\r\nIt was suspected that Mud Lake water quality may be deteriorating. This indeed was\r\nthe case, and the investigations carried out in 1994 have been documented in a\r\nseparate report which has been submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Energy\r\nin December 1994. In the Mud Lake Report, detailed recommendations are made for\r\na full hydrological assessment of the entire site in 1995.\r\nThe deterioration of Decant Pond water quality, due to acid discharge from the tailings beach (noted in 1992), has been successfully counteracted through the installation of\r\nan ARUM (Acid Reduction Using Microbiology) berm along the beach. Treatment of\r\nthe acid pool on the tailings with phosphate rock has reduced the iron and aluminum\r\nloadings to the pond. Zinc concentrations in the discharge from Decant Pond have\r\nbeen around 1 mglL in 1994, as compared to 9 mglL by the end of 1992.\r\nThe biological polishing process, its capacity to remove zinc, along with detailed\r\nevaluations of iron cycling, sediment chemistry and the work carried out on the\r\nphosphate rock applications in Boomerang Lake, have been summarized in a report\r\nentitled: Biological Polishing Phase IV: Model Verification and Scale-up (CANMET\r\nContract, July 1994). This report has also been submitted to the Ministry of\r\nEnvironment and Energy, and describes part of the ongoing research for the decommissioning of the South Bay mine site."

            "Based on the results of the initial EM geophysical survey (summer, 1994) conducted north of\r\nthe tailings disposal basin, and a subsequent preliminary test drilling and piezometer installation\r\nprogram during the fall of 1994, a buried valley was found, which appears to be the main path\r\nfor subsurface contaminant movement from the tailings area in the direction of Mud Lake.\r\nSubsequently, Boojum Research obtained additional funding for further, much more extensive\r\nEM geophysical surveys and funding for an extensive test drilling and piezometer installation\r\nprogram. This latter program had as its objectives to ground truth the EM surveys and at the\r\nsame time define the bedrock topography, the hydrogeological environment and the\r\ncontaminant paths. The cost estimate for the test drilling and piezometer installation were\r\nprepared based on the objectives outlined above and submitted in November, 1994, prior to its\r\nsubmission to the client.\r\nOnce all this information had been compiled and interpreted, design scenarios for remedial\r\nmeasures would be developed.\r\nThe drilling and piezometer installation program was to be conducted during the late winter to\r\nensure maximum mobility. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen climatic conditions, drilling and\r\npiezometer installation in the northern part of the Mud Lake basin was not possible, nor in any\r\narea with floating muskeg. As a result, the program was redesigned based on the new EM\r\ngeophysical data and the same objectives, outlined above, for areas which were accessible\r\nduring April/May, 1995. A total of \u00b1 30 new testhole/piezometer locations were chosen. Cost\r\nestimates were obtained from a drilling company and their estimated cost fell within the\r\nestimate submitted in the fall of 1994.\r\nThe testdrilling and piezometer installation program was carried out from April 25 to May 14, 1995. Subsequently, slug tests were conducted on the piezometers to determine the hydraulic\r\nconductivity. A total of 40 piezometers were installed. 24 (deep) piezometers were completed\r\nimmediately above the bedrock surface, 9 shallow piezometers were installed in close proximity\r\nto the deeper ones, and an additional 7 shallow piezometers were installed in separated\r\nlocations. All of the latter shallow piezometers are located in the vicinity of the northwestern part\r\nof the tailings basin. A total of 9 testholes (without piezometer installation) were drilled. The\r\napproximate location of the testholes is shown in Plate 1.\r\nWeather conditions during the fieldwork varied from a blizzard to + 20 0\r\nC.\r\nThe evaluation of the data and this report were delayed, because of inadequacies in the survey\r\nof the elevation and location of the new piezometers and testholes. Although, the problems with\r\nthe survey data have not been solved yet, at the instruction of Boojum Research the interpretation of the data collected has proceeded."

During 1995, the electromagnetic surveying was focused in four areas:\r\n(1) Mud Lake\r\n(2) West of the Tailings\r\n(3) South of the Tailings/ Townsite\r\n(4) Mine Site\r\nNumerous geophysical anomalies were identified, and anomalies with unexplained\r\nsources of conductivity were tested during an extensive programme of piezometer\r\ninstallation.\r\nThis section presents the results of the geophysical surveys in the Mud Lake area\r\nand west of the tailings area, along with water quality data obtained from the\r\npiezometers that were installed to test geophysical anomalies. These areas are all\r\n\u201cexploratory\u201d in nature where the surveys are being conducted for the first time.\r\nThe survey was carried out step by step, adding lines as was indicated due to\r\nanomalies. Those were then used to place piezometers, and confirm or refute the presence of seepage pathways and delineate their extent."

            "In 1995, after 10 years of monitoring the ground water flow from a small Cu/Zn base metal\r\ntailings depositinNorthernOntario,the ground water flow paths were re-evaluated to confirm\r\npreviously predicted flowdirections. A highly contaminated ground water seepage had taken\r\nin 1996 a different route and was emerging to the surface contaminating a small lake (Mud\r\nLake). However the seepage path was well defined hydro-geologically and hence it may be\r\nsuitable for in-situ-treatment. Geo-microbiological in-situ treatment approaches were\r\nconsidered jointly with Dr. Ferris ( University of Toronto). It was proposed, that through\r\nmicrobial urea degradation ground water pH could be increased, resulting in metal\r\nprecipitation in-situ improving the seepage discharge quality.\r\nA research program was initiated in 1997/98 based on the concept ofin situ-increasing the\r\npH through microbial activity which should result in metal precipitation (Schematic 1). This\r\napproach needed to be substantiated with microbiological testing and geochemical\r\nmodelling. This was carried out by Dr. G. D. Ferris at the University of Toronto. Boojum\r\nResearch Ltd. developed a ground water model for the site to define the quantity of\r\ngroundwater to be treated and field tested urea degradation."

            "Mill Pond is located to the east of a topographic divide on the mill site. It receives surface\r\nrunoff and shallow groundwater discharge. At the northeastern/ eastern part a small dam\r\nhas been constructed.\r\nThe surface elevation of the water level in Mill Pond is such, that it is higher than the\r\nelevation of the seeps WHS and WHSS. Mill Pond could, therefore, be a source of water\r\ncontributing to these seeps. Unfortunately, there is neither shallow stratigraphic\r\ninformation nor information with respect to the configuration of the bedrock surface\r\nbetween Mill Pond and the seeps to indicate a potential path for the shallow\r\ngroundwater. Furthermore, it would be next to impossible to obtain this information,\r\nbecause of the effect of the decommissioning and subsequent landscaping of the mill\r\nsite.\r\nThe only way to determine a possible inter-relationship between the seeps and Mill Pond\r\nis to drain the pond temporarily and observe the effect of the draining. The experiment\r\nwas started on June 3, 1998, after a siphon, which drains towards Boomerang Lake, had\r\nbeen installed in the Mill Pond. Daily and on occasion multiple daily measurements were\r\ntaken of the flow at various locations on the mine site, the water levels in piezometers,\r\nshaft, PRC, etc. Furthermore precipitation was recorded, as well as basic chemical\r\nparameters were measured and water samples were collected for future analysis."

        "description": [
            "Groundwater flow can constitute one of the major flow paths along which contaminants\r\nare transported away from a particular surface site. The surface site can, generally\r\nspeaking, be relatively easily managed with the appropriate containment structures, flow\r\nand chemistry monitoring, etc. Accidental spills and escapes are generally immediately\r\nnoticed and remedial measures are, in most instances, relatively easily implemented.\r\nHowever, the liquid component of any waste stored at surface, unless very specific\r\nengineered measures are taken, is in contact with the underlying sediments. This\r\nscenario is the rule rather than the exception. Liquids with their contained contaminant\r\nload will infiltrate the underlying sediments. The degree and rate of infiltration is a multicomponent\r\nfunction of the underlying sediments, the waste and the hydrogeological\r\nsetting. Once the contaminants are incorporated in the groundwater, the hydrogeological\r\nenvironment will determine the rate and the direction of flow away from the surface\r\ncontainment area. Furthermore, it should be realized, that liquids, which infiltrate\r\nsediments and are incorporated in the groundwater flow system, will, with time, be\r\ndischarged to the surface environment again.\r\nIn order to obtain a reasonable framework of the subsurface environment, test drilling is\r\ndone to define the stratigraphy and piezometers are installed to obtain information on the\r\nhydraulic head and permeability distribution. In addition, water samples are taken to\r\ndefine the chemistry of the groundwater and to monitor the movement of the\r\ncontaminants.\r\nGroundwater flow is an essential component of the water budget and its chemistry in any\r\ngiven area. Groundwater flow differs from surface water flow by its inherent time delay.\r\nIn other words, contaminant transport in surface water is, relatively speaking, immediate,\r\nwhile in the subsurface it is, generally speaking, very slow. This means, that although\r\nthere is active groundwater contamination below a waste site, it can take many years\r\nbefore it re-occurs at surface some distance away from the site. This further means, that\r\nthe monitoring requirements for the subsurface are unequivocally long-term"

            "The three basic objectives of the Phase one modelling described in this report were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n- Develop a global site-wide model encompassing all of the significant water\r\nsheds in the vicinity of the site in order to determine the effective dilution via\r\ngroundwater of contaminated water with water from uncontaminated areas. This\r\ncan then be used together with measured surface water flows to determine\r\nexpected contaminant concentrations in various water bodies.\r\n-Use the results of the global site-wide model to construct a more detailed tailings\r\narea model and calibrate this model to simulate the measured existing flow\r\npatterns.\r\n-Use the detailed tailings area model to simulate the release and transport of\r\ncontaminants from the tailings area into the various receiving water bodies.\r\nAs stated above, two models were developed for this study, a global site-wide model\r\nand a more detailed tailings area model.\r\nThe major input parameters required by both of the models are summarized in Chapter\r\n2 and the development and results of the global site-wide model are described in\r\nChapter 3. The development and results of the failings area model are given in\r\nChapter 4. Conclusions and recommendations for further work are given in Chapter 5."

With the vision of increasing plant biomass and biological polishing capacity through fertilization, results from this report will be used to formulate a sampling and analytical strategy for determining the effects of foliar fertilization on below-ground biomass of cattails growing on acidic tailings at a uranium mine in Elliot Lake, Ont. Preliminary cattail samples were collected locally and subjected to the procedures deemed appropriate for determining whether applications of foliar fertilizer on tailings-grown cattails would have an effect on plant health. The methods used during the preliminary trial were appropriate for providing data on a number of growth-related parameters and required only minor sample-specific adjustment to obtain accurate results. Data obtained while evaluating the methods, along with findings from other studies, indicated that pith size may be an important below-ground morphological indicator of plant health."

The prime objective of this exercise would have been\r\nto elucidate the effects of the various ditches constructed at the site. No simulations\r\nhave been performed, however, because the analyses representing the July and\r\nAugust 1994 samples from these sources are incomplete, missing all major ions.\r\nAvailable analyses for samples collected from a number of selected points at the South\r\nBay site, between October 1986 and September 1994, have been plotted to determine\r\nwhere heavy-metal concentrations are increasing or decreasing with time. In the\r\ngraphs, the lines representing [Cu] and [Zn] are drawn heavy to make recognition\r\neasier.\r\nIt has been assumed that the analyses are representative for the chemical composition\r\nof the various sources at the time of sample collection. If additional analyses exist for\r\nthe locations represented by these graphs, incorporation of such analyses should\r\nprobably be considered.\r\nIt should be kept in mind that the detection limits for the heavy metals were apparently set at 1.0 or 0.1 mglL, rather than 0.01 mglL or lower, for some of the pre-1994\r\nanalyses. Thus some of the graphs may give the erroneous impression of very low\r\nmetal concentrations during the early 1990\u2019s."

            "Groundwater with a low pH and contaminated with heavy metals is entering Mud Lake.\r\nThis water body has been identified as the best site to treat this water before it enters\r\nConfederation Lake. Biological treatment using ARUM (Acid Reduction Using\r\nMicrobiology) is the suggested treatment method.\r\nA laboratory experiment was carried out to determine whether ARUM can remove Zn\r\nand other contaminants from Mud Lake water. A preliminary experiment was carried out\r\nto determine what would happen to the groundwater in oxidising conditions. Such\r\nconditions will be present in the mixed surface waters of Mud Lake. This experiment\r\nsought to determine whether, to what extent and at what rate Fe oxidation and\r\nsubsequent precipitation of Fe(OH), can occur.  This experiment determined that aeration of groundwater entering Mud Lake (GD trap\r\nwater) at room temperature (similar to summer conditions in the field) results in\r\noxidation, hydrolysis and precipitation of Fe commencing at 88 h. From around 213 h,\r\nan equilibrium between Fez' and Fe3' is attained with no further net oxidation or removal\r\nof Fe from solution. Oxidation rate was estimated as around 103 mg.m-3.min-' and was\r\nlittle influenced by the presence of a sediment. However, in the presence of sediment\r\napproximately 50 % of the Fe and acidity in the water was removed in 27 days.\r\nIn cold room conditions, where the temperature (1-5OC) is similar to what would be\r\nencountered within and just above sediments in the field in winter, oxidation did not\r\noccur during the first 27 day period of observations with all Fe remaining in the Fe2+\r\nstate. However, within 72 days oxidation had commenced in jars with sediment and pH\r\nhad declined to <3. As at room temperature, 50 YO of the acidity and Fe was removed\r\nby the sediment. \r\nARUM worked very well on groundwater entering Mud Lake (GD trap water). Within 23\r\ndays at room temperature, dissolved Zn concentration was reduced from >80 mg.L-' to\r\n4 mg.L-' in reducing condition induced through addition of decomposable organic matter\r\n(alfalfa or potato waste). With added alfalfa some of the Zn remained in the suspended\r\nsolid fraction. This is potentially mobile. With potato waste, the Zn was almost totally\r\nremoved to the sediment. Therefore, potato waste is the amendment of choice. In cold\r\nroom conditions, and in the presence of an amendment and Mud Lake sediment,\r\nreducing conditions were established in Mud Lake groundwater within 54 days and Zn\r\nconcentration reduced to 0.334 mg.L-' in the presence of potato waste."

This year, two lines were added at both the east and\r\nwest ends, and the complete grid surveyed with receiver - transmitter coil separations\r\nof 10 m, 20 m and 40 m. In the March 1992 survey, only 10 and 20 m coil separations\r\nwere used. The 1992 results are presented on Maps MS-1 to MS-3 and the 1995 results\r\non Maps MS-4 to MS-8. Differences between two sets of results are on MS-9 and MS10.\r\n\r\nAlthough the 1995 survey recovered the same 10 anomalies initially identified in\r\n1992, differences in both horizontal and vertical positioning, as well as changes in the\r\nlevels of conductivity, imply that significant changes have occurred in the groundwater\r\nregime in the area of the Mine Site. Some of these changes appear to be directly related\r\nto the presence of the Backfill Raise Diversion Ditch which was constructed shortly after the 1992 survey."

            "The Rayrock Mine Site is located about 145 km northwest of\r\nYellowknife and 56 km north of Marian Lake. Rayrock Mines\r\nLimited recovered 458,000 pounds of yellow-cake between June 1957\r\nand July 1959, leaving about 80,000 tons of tailings in two\r\npiles to the south of the mine site. The piles cover an area of\r\nabout 6 and 8 ha. are free of vegetation and have small water\r\nbodies in depressions on the edges of the pile and at lowest\r\npoints of the pile. These waters directly in contact with\r\ntailings appear to be high in radium and copper, reflecting the\r\nelevated concentrations of these elements in the tailings.\r\nRadium.. and lead-210 concentrations are high in the tailings compared to other abandoned or inactive  uranium mill tailings sites in Canada.\r\nHowever, the concentrations in the waste material can range from 350 to 3,300 pCi /g for Radium-226 and\r\n350 to 3,000 pCi/g for Lead-210. A representative average concentration for Radium-226 and Lead-210 in \r\nthe Rayrock tailings cannot be determined as only a small sample set has been analyzed. Contaminated soil underneath a tailings cover, particularly in the North tailings pile arid on the edges of both\r\npiles, was found. The size of the area with contaminated soil is not known , but. this soil may be a source of contamination for vegetation rooted below the thin tailings cover. A second possible source of \r\ncontamination of vegetation in the vicinity may be windblown tailings originating from the more\r\ndry, South tailings pile. Although the coarse tailings are weak acid generating and have been in contact with some water bodies for more than two decades, the water pH has riot been affected. The\r\nwater quality parameter analyzed for Sherman Lake and the downstream system suggest, tentatively,\r\nthat on the small Lakes Alpha and Gamma have been contaminated, but all other water bodies show no evidence of contamination related to the tailings decomposition."

These species formed wetland communities which varied in\r\nsize, but all were essentially monocultures of Typha latifolia, T. angustifolia, or of the\r\nhybrids T. glauca. Sedges, Scripus cyperinus (wool-grass) and Phragmites australis (reedgrass),\r\nwere found in transition zones between the cattail stand and the dry section of the\r\ntailings site. The expansion of the cattail stands appeared to be controlled by the\r\nhydrological conditions on the site, rather than the chemical characteristics of the tailings."

            "As part of the decommissioning plans of Goldcorp Inc., the potential of acid generation\r\nfrom the tailings was addressed with acid base accounting tests, The occurrence of acid\r\ngenerating minerals along with neutralizing minerals is extremely varied and the limited\r\nnumber of ABA tests lead to uncertain results. Boojum Research Ltd. was retained to\r\nassess the acid generation potential further. From a field investigation of the surface water on the tailings it was concluded, that within\r\none year of cessation of tailings discharge, the physical/chemical conditions ofthe ponded\r\nwater resembles those ofthe surrounding fresh water and supports considerable biological\r\nactivity. The pH in ponded water on the tailings ranged from 7.0 to 8.6 and in the\r\nsediments/tailings pH values as high as 9.1 were measured. The electrical conductivity\r\nwas low, with values ranging between 200 umhos/cm to 1000 umhoslcm. These surface \r\nwaters would facilitate ecological approaches to decommissioning.  To determine a reliable estimate of the quantity of acid generating minerals in the tailings,\r\ndata were extracted from mineralogical and milling records in addition to chemical analysis\r\nreported for tailings. The data consistently produce an average of 1.5% S, 6.7% Fe and\r\n2.7% Al. Sequential extraction of the tailings for mineral association produced a weight loss\r\nof 42%, the remaining 68% of the tailings are totally inert. Of the digestible fraction, 29%\r\nconsisted of alkalinity generating minerals and 21% of potentially acid generating minerals,\r\nthus the neutralizing potential mass is equal to that of the acid generating mass. Through the extraction of weathering products which had formed in the tailings the\r\nongoing oxidation, leading to acid generation and the concurrent neutralization was\r\ndetermined. Tailings material collected from old (32 years) and new ( 10 years) tailings\r\nponds was leached with distilled water. The leach solutions were all above pH 7 and\r\nalkalinity between 50 to 210 mg.L-\u2019 CaCO, equivalent. The tailings material clearly has\r\nremaining neutralization potential left. In the leachate from visually oxidizing tailings, 36% of S in the solids was mobilized with water, along with 14% Ca afler 10 years of exposure\r\nin the tailings pond. In the visually unoxidized sample exposed for the same time only\r\n2.3% of the S and 2.2% of the Ca could be liberated by distilled water. Acid generation and\r\nits concurrent neutralization appears to be localized in pockets of the tailings pond. The\r\nrate of acid generation and neutralization has not been determined. It can be concluded\r\nthat effluent problems normally associated with acid generating tailings will not be\r\nencountered for the Goldcorp Inc. tailings area. The concentrate stored on the tailings is\r\nacid generating. It is at present unclear, if some piezometer water quality is affected by this material."

            "Effluent treatment from gold milling requires the removal of heavy metals, cyanide and\r\narsenic. The waters are generally alkaline and hence this presents a technical problem\r\nregarding the choice of a removal process. Conventional water treatment processes for arsenic removal include chemical oxidation (chlorination), coagulation - flocculation, liming, filtration, activated carbon adsorption and,\r\nultimately, processes such as demineralizing by reverse osmosis or ion exchange. In principal, therefore, it is possible to select a treatment technology which will produce the\r\ndesired effluent quality; however, the costs associated with the treatment technology are\r\nfrequently prohibitive. The cost effectiveness of a treatment process is therefore equally\r\nimportant. With increasing environmental awareness, the treatment technologies do not only\r\nhave to be economic and technically effective, but consideration has to be given to the long term\r\nstability of the resultant sludge. In addition, the decommissioning of the these facilities,\r\nalong with the disturbed areas, has to be considered. The CREM task force has evaluated these technologies for their effectiveness. For arsenic, liming or softening was considered the most effective method which also removes any heavy metals. These methods produce sludges which represent an environmental problem. Therefore, better and more environmentally acceptable treatment processes have to be\r\ndeveloped."
